https://leetcode.cn/problems/same-tree/


Given the roots of two binary trees p and q, write a function to check if they are the same or not.

Two binary trees are considered the same if they are structurally identical, and the nodes have the same value.

**Example:**

**Input:** `p = [1,2,3], q = [1,2,3]`
**Output:** `true`
 
**Input:** `p = [1,2], q = [1,null,2]`
**Output:** `false`

**Input:** `p = [1,2,1], q = [1,1,2]`
**Output:** `false`
