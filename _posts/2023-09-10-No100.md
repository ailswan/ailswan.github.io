        if not p and not q:
                  return True
              if not p or not q:
                  return False
              return p.val == q.val and self.isSameTree(p.left, q.left) and self.isSameTree(p.right, q.right)

### Problem Statement
**link:**
https://leetcode.com/problems/same-tree/
https://leetcode.cn/problems/same-tree/


Given the roots of two binary trees p and q, write a function to check if they are the same or not.

Two binary trees are considered the same if they are structurally identical, and the nodes have the same value.

**Example:**

**Input:** `p = [1,2,3], q = [1,2,3]`
**Output:** `true`
 
**Input:** `p = [1,2], q = [1,null,2]`
**Output:** `false`

**Input:** `p = [1,2,1], q = [1,1,2]`
**Output:** `false`
 

### Solution Approach
The approach is to use a depth-first search (DFS) to traverse both trees simultaneously and compare the values and structure at each step.
 
#### Algorithm
1. If both trees are empty, return True.
2. If one of the trees is empty, return False.
3. Compare the values of the current nodes of both trees.
4. Recursively compare the left subtrees and the right subtrees.
