[LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/palindromic-substrings/)
Given a string s, return the number of palindromic substrings in it.

A string is a palindrome when it reads the same backward as forward.

A substring is a contiguous sequence of characters within the string.
**Example:**

**Input:** `s = "abc"`
**Output:** `3`

**Input:** `s = "aaa"`
**Output:** `6`
