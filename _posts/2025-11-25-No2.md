### Problem Statement

[LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/add-two-numbers/)
You are given two non-empty linked lists representing two non-negative integers. The digits are stored in reverse order, and each of their nodes contains a single digit. Add the two numbers and return the sum as a linked list.

You may assume the two numbers do not contain any leading zero, except the number 0 itself.

**Example:**

**Input:** `l1 = [2,4,3], l2 = [5,6,4]`
**Output:** `[7,0,8]`

**Input:** `l1 = [0], l2 = [0]`
**Output:** `[0]`

**Input:** `l1 = [9,9,9,9,9,9,9], l2 = [9,9,9,9]`
**Output:** `[8,9,9,9,0,0,0,1]`

**Constraints:**
The number of nodes in each linked list is in the range [1, 100].
0 <= Node.val <= 9
It is guaranteed that the list represents a number that does not have leading zeros.
