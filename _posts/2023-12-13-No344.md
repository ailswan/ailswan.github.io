Write a function that reverses a string. The input string is given as an array of characters s.

You must do this by modifying the input array in-place with O(1) extra memory.
 
**Example:**

**Input:** `s = ["h","e","l","l","o"]`
**Output:** `["o","l","l","e","h"]`
 
**Input:** `s = ["H","a","n","n","a","h"]`
**Output:** `["h","a","n","n","a","H"]`
