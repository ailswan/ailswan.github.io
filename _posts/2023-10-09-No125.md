### Problem Statement
**link:**
https://leetcode.com/problems/valid-palindrome/
https://leetcode.cn/problems/valid-palindrome/

A phrase is a palindrome if, after converting all uppercase letters into lowercase letters and removing all non-alphanumeric characters, it reads the same forward and backward. Alphanumeric characters include letters and numbers.

Given a string s, return true if it is a palindrome, or false otherwise.

**Example:**

**Input:** `s = "A man, a plan, a canal: Panama"`
**Output:** `true`
 
**Input:** `s = "race a car"`
**Output:** `false`
 
**Input:** `s = " "`
**Output:** `true`
 

### Solution Approach
The solution employs a two-pointer technique, checking characters from both ends of the string, and converging towards the center.
 
#### Algorithm
1. Initialization: Initiate two pointers, l and r, pointing to the start and the end of the string respectively.
2. Pointer Movement: Move pointers l and r inward until they point to alphanumeric characters, skipping any non-alphanumeric characters.
3. Comparison: Compare the characters at l and r (after converting to lowercase). If they don't match, return False. If they match or pointers cross each other, return True.
