### Problem Statement
**link:**
[LeetCode.cn](https://leetcode.cn/problems/diameter-of-binary-tree/)
[LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/diameter-of-binary-tree/)

Given the root of a binary tree, return the length of the diameter of the tree.

The diameter of a binary tree is the length of the longest path between any two nodes in a tree. This path may or may not pass through the root.

The length of a path between two nodes is represented by the number of edges between them.

**Example:**

**Input:** `root = [3,5,1,6,2,0,8,null,null,7,4], p = 5, q = 1`
**Output:** `3`
 
**Input:** `root = [3,5,1,6,2,0,8,null,null,7,4], p = 5, q = 4`
**Output:** `5`

**Input:** `root = [1,2], p = 1, q = 2`
**Output:** `1`

 
### Solution Approach
#### method1
Utilizes recursive traversal to identify the lowest common ancestor by exploring the binary tree from the root downward.
#### method2
Finds paths from the root to the given nodes and then determines their lowest common ancestor by iterating over these paths.

#### Algorithm
#### method1
This method utilizes a recursive approach to traverse the binary tree.
It starts from the root and recursively explores the left and right subtrees.
If either of the given nodes p or q is found, the current node is returned.
If both p and q are found in different subtrees, the current node is the lowest common ancestor (LCA).
If both nodes are found in the same subtree, the process continues until the LCA is found.
#### method2
This method involves finding paths from the root to nodes p and q using DFS.
It traverses the tree twice to find paths for both nodes.
Once paths for both nodes are obtained, it iterates over the paths simultaneously.
The last common node before paths diverge is considered the lowest common ancestor (LCA).
This method offers an alternative approach by explicitly finding paths to nodes and then identifying the LCA.
