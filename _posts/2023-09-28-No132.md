### Problem Statement
**link:**
https://leetcode.com/problems/palindrome-partitioning-ii/
https://leetcode.cn/problems/palindrome-partitioning-ii/

Given a string s, partition s such that every 
substring of the partition is a palindrome.

Return the minimum cuts needed for a palindrome partitioning of s.

**Example:**

**Input:** `s = "aab"`
**Output:** `1`
 
**Input:** `s = "a"`
**Output:** `0`
 
**Input:** `s = "ab"`
**Output:** `1`

### Solution Approach
The solution leverages dynamic programming to precompute palindromic substrings and subsequently calculate the minimum cuts needed for each character in the string.
 
#### Algorithm   
1. Palindrome Precomputation: Construct a 2D boolean matrix (is_pal) to determine if substrings between indices (i, j) are palindromes.
2. DP Initialization: Formulate a 1D DP array (dp) with dp[i] signifying the minimal cuts needed for the substring leading up to index i.
3. DP Transition: For each character, if its substring is a palindrome, set its dp value to 0; otherwise, iterate through previous characters to update its value based on prior minimum cuts and palindrome checks.
