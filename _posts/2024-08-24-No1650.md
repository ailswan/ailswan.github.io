### Problem Statement
**link:**

[LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/lowest-common-ancestor-of-a-binary-tree-iii/)
Given two nodes of a binary tree p and q, return their lowest common ancestor (LCA).

Each node will have a reference to its parent node. The definition for Node is below:

class Node {
    public int val;
    public Node left;
    public Node right;
    public Node parent;
}
According to the definition of LCA on Wikipedia: "The lowest common ancestor of two nodes p and q in a tree T is the lowest node that has both p and q as descendants (where we allow a node to be a descendant of itself)."

**Example:**

**Input:** `Input: root = [3,5,1,6,2,0,8,null,null,7,4], p = 5, q = 1`
**Output:** `3`

**Input:** `root = [3,5,1,6,2,0,8,null,null,7,4], p = 5, q = 4`
**Output:** `5`

**Input:** `root = [1,2], p = 1, q = 2`
**Output:** `1`


**Constraints:**
The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [2, 105].
-109 <= Node.val <= 109
All Node.val are unique.
p != q
p and q exist in the tree.

### Solution Approach
 
#### Algorithm

#### Complexity
 **time complexity**: O(h)
 **space complexity**: O(h)
