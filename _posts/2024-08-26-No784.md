### Problem Statement
**link:**
https://leetcode.com/problems/letter-case-permutation/
https://leetcode.cn/problems/letter-case-permutation/
 
Given a string s, you can transform every letter individually to be lowercase or uppercase to create another string.

Return a list of all possible strings we could create. Return the output in any order.


**Example:**

**Input:** `s = "a1b2"`
**Output:** `["a1b2","a1B2","A1b2","A1B2"]`
 
**Input:** `s = "3z4"`
**Output:** `["3z4","3Z4"]`
 

### Solution Approach
The algorithm uses a breadth-first search (BFS) approach to generate all possible letter case permutations by systematically exploring each character's uppercase and lowercase options.

#### Algorithm
1. Breadth-First Search (BFS): The algorithm uses BFS to explore all possible permutations of the string by processing each character's uppercase and lowercase variations.
2. Character Case Handling: For each character in the string, it generates new permutations by either maintaining the current case or swapping the case if the character is alphabetic.
3. Queue for Permutations: A queue is employed to manage and expand permutations incrementally, ensuring that all combinations are explored before finalizing the results.
#### Complexity
 **time complexity**: O(n * 2^n)
 **space complexity**: O(n * 2^n )
