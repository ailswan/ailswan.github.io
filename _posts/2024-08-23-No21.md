### Problem Statement
**link:**
[LeetCode.cn](https://leetcode.cn/problems/merge-two-sorted-lists/)
[LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/merge-two-sorted-lists/)
You are given the heads of two sorted linked lists list1 and list2.

Merge the two lists into one sorted list. The list should be made by splicing together the nodes of the first two lists.

Return the head of the merged linked list.

**Example:**

**Input:** `list1 = [1,2,4], list2 = [1,3,4]`
**Output:** `[1,1,2,3,4,4]`

**Input:** `list1 = [], list2 = []`
**Output:** `[]`

**Input:** `list1 = [], list2 = [0]`
**Output:** `[0]`


**Constraints:**
The number of nodes in both lists is in the range [0, 50].
-100 <= Node.val <= 100
Both list1 and list2 are sorted in non-decreasing order.

### Solution Approach
Iteratively compare nodes from both lists, attaching the smaller node to a new dummy list, and finally append any remaining nodes.

#### Algorithm
1. Iterative Comparison: Compare the values of nodes from both lists, appending the smaller node to the merged list and advancing the corresponding list pointer.
2. Dummy Node: Use a dummy node to simplify list operations and facilitate easy attachment of nodes from the two lists.
3. Handle Remaining Nodes: After one of the lists is exhausted, directly attach the remaining nodes of the other list to the end of the merged list.
