### Problem Statement
**link:**
[LeetCode.cn](https://leetcode.cn/problems/determine-if-two-strings-are-close/)
[LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/determine-if-two-strings-are-close/)
Two strings are considered close if you can attain one from the other using the following operations:

Operation 1: Swap any two existing characters.
For example, abcde -> aecdb
Operation 2: Transform every occurrence of one existing character into another existing character, and do the same with the other character.
For example, aacabb -> bbcbaa (all a's turn into b's, and all b's turn into a's)
You can use the operations on either string as many times as necessary.

Given two strings, word1 and word2, return true if word1 and word2 are close, and false otherwise.

**Example:**

**Input:** `word1 = "abc", word2 = "bca"`
**Output:** `true`

**Input:** `word1 = "a", word2 = "aa"`
**Output:** `false`

**Input:** `word1 = "cabbba", word2 = "abbccc"`
**Output:** `true`
 
### Solution Approach
To determine if two strings are close, check if they have the same unique characters and if the sorted frequencies of these characters match.

#### Algorithm
1. **Check Character Sets**: Verify that both strings contain the same unique characters by comparing the sets of characters in each string.
2. **Count Character Frequencies**: Use a frequency count to determine how many times each character appears in both strings.
3. **Compare Sorted Frequencies**: Ensure that the sorted lists of character frequencies are identical for both strings.
