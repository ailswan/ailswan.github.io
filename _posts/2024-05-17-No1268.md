### Problem Statement
**link:**
[LeetCode.cn](https://leetcode.cn/problems/search-suggestions-system/)
[LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/search-suggestions-system/)
You are given an array of strings products and a string searchWord.

Design a system that suggests at most three product names from products after each character of searchWord is typed. Suggested products should have common prefix with searchWord. If there are more than three products with a common prefix return the three lexicographically minimums products.

Return a list of lists of the suggested products after each character of searchWord is typed.

**Example:**

**Input:** `products = ["mobile","mouse","moneypot","monitor","mousepad"], searchWord = "mouse"`
**Output:** `[["mobile","moneypot","monitor"],["mobile","moneypot","monitor"],["mouse","mousepad"],["mouse","mousepad"],["mouse","mousepad"]]`

**Input:** `products = ["havana"], searchWord = "havana"`
**Output:** `[["havana"],["havana"],["havana"],["havana"],["havana"],["havana"]]`
 
### Solution Approach
The solution involves using a Trie data structure to store the products. As we build the Trie, each node maintains a list of up to three lexicographically smallest words that pass through that node. For each character in the search word, we traverse the Trie to collect the lists of suggested products.
#### Algorithm
 1. **Trie Construction:** Build a Trie where each node stores a list of up to three lexicographically smallest products that pass through that node. Insert each product into the Trie, ensuring that the node lists are kept sorted and trimmed to a maximum of three entries.
2. **Word Addition:** As each product is added to the Trie, traverse its characters, adding the product to the node lists. If a node list exceeds three products, remove the largest product to maintain only the smallest three.
3. **Search and Suggestion:** For each character in the search word, traverse the Trie from the root, collecting the list of suggestions from the current node. If a character is not found in the Trie, return empty lists for the remaining characters of the search word.
