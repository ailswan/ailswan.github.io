### Problem Statement
**link:**
https://leetcode.com/problems/maximal-square/
https://leetcode.cn/problems/maximal-square/
 
Given an m x n binary matrix filled with 0's and 1's, find the largest square containing only 1's and return its area.

**Example:**

**Input:** ` matrix = [["1","0","1","0","0"],["1","0","1","1","1"],["1","1","1","1","1"],["1","0","0","1","0"]]`
**Output:** `4`
 
**Input:** `matrix = [["0","1"],["1","0"]]`
**Output:** `1`
 
**Input:** `matrix = [["0"]]`
**Output:** `0`

### Solution Approach
The problem is solved using dynamic programming. We iterate through the given binary matrix, maintaining a 2D array to track the largest square ending at each position. The final answer is the square of the maximum value in this 2D array.

#### Algorithm
1. Dynamic Programming: Use dynamic programming to compute the side length of squares ending at each position.
2. Square Expansion Logic: For each '1' in the matrix, calculate the square's side length by taking the minimum of adjacent squares and incrementing it by 1.
3. Maximal Square Area: Maintain 'res' as the maximum side length encountered and return 'res' squared as the largest square area.
