### Problem Statement
**link:**

https://leetcode.cn/problems/word-ladder-ii/

A transformation sequence from word beginWord to word endWord using a dictionary wordList is a sequence of words beginWord -> s1 -> s2 -> ... -> sk such that:

Every adjacent pair of words differs by a single letter.
Every si for 1 <= i <= k is in wordList. Note that beginWord does not need to be in wordList.
sk == endWord
Given two words, beginWord and endWord, and a dictionary wordList, return all the shortest transformation sequences from beginWord to endWord, or an empty list if no such sequence exists. Each sequence should be returned as a list of the words [beginWord, s1, s2, ..., sk].

**Example:**

**Input:** `beginWord = "hit", endWord = "cog", wordList = ["hot","dot","dog","lot","log","cog"]`
**Output:** `[["hit","hot","dot","dog","cog"],["hit","hot","lot","log","cog"]]`
 
**Input:** `beginWord = "hit", endWord = "cog", wordList = ["hot","dot","dog","lot","log"]`
**Output:** `[]`
