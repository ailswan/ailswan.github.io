Given an array of strings strs, group the anagrams together. You can return the answer in any order.

An Anagram is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of a different word or phrase, typically using all the original letters exactly once.

**Example:**

**Input:** `strs = ["eat","tea","tan","ate","nat","bat"]`
**Output:** `[["bat"],["nat","tan"],["ate","eat","tea"]]`

**Input:** `strs = [""]`
**Output:** `[[""]]`

**Input:** `strs = ["a"]`
**Output:** `[["a"]]`
