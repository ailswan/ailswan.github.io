### Problem Statement
**link:**
[LeetCode.cn](https://leetcode.cn/problems/factorial-trailing-zeroes/)
[LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/factorial-trailing-zeroes/)
Given an integer n, return the number of trailing zeroes in n!.

Note that n! = n * (n - 1) * (n - 2) * ... * 3 * 2 * 1.

**Example:**

**Input:** `n = 3`
**Output:** `0`

**Input:** `n = 5`
**Output:** `1`

**Input:** `n = 0`
**Output:** `0`
 
### Solution Approach
To find the number of trailing zeroes in n!, count how many multiples of 5 are there up to n.
#### Algorithm
Certainly! Here are three key points for finding the number of trailing zeroes in `n!`:

1. **Understanding Trailing Zeroes**: Trailing zeroes in `n!` are formed by factors of 10, which are produced by pairs of factors 2 and 5. However, in factorials, there are always more factors of 2 than 5, so the count of trailing zeroes is determined by the number of times 5 is a factor in numbers from 1 to `n`.

2. **Counting Multiples of 5**: To find out how many trailing zeroes `n!` has, count how many multiples of 5 exist up to `n`. Each multiple contributes at least one factor of 5 to the factorial sequence, which correlates directly with the number of trailing zeroes.

3. **Iterative Approach**: Start with `ans` initialized to 0. Iterate through multiples of 5 (`5, 10, 15, ...`) up to `n`, counting how many times each multiple contributes a factor of 5 by continuously dividing by 5 until the quotient is no longer divisible by 5. Sum these counts to get the total number of trailing zeroes in `n!`.
