### Problem Statement
**link:**
https://leetcode.com/problems/insert-interval/
https://leetcode.cn/problems/insert-interval/

You are given an array of non-overlapping intervals intervals where intervals[i] = [starti, endi] represent the start and the end of the ith interval and intervals is sorted in ascending order by starti. You are also given an interval newInterval = [start, end] that represents the start and end of another interval.

Insert newInterval into intervals such that intervals is still sorted in ascending order by starti and intervals still does not have any overlapping intervals (merge overlapping intervals if necessary).

Return intervals after the insertion.

**Example:**

**Input:** `intervals = [[1,3],[6,9]], newInterval = [2,5]`
**Output:** `[[1,5],[6,9]]`

**Input:** `intervals = [[1,2],[3,5],[6,7],[8,10],[12,16]], newInterval = [4,8]`
**Output:** `[[1,2],[3,10],[12,16]]`

### Solution Approach
Insert the new interval into the list of intervals, merging it with any overlapping intervals to ensure non-overlap.
 

#### Algorithm
1. Iterate over the list of intervals, adding those that come before the new interval without overlapping to the result.
2. Modify the new interval by merging it with any overlapping intervals from the list, ensuring the final new interval does not overlap with any existing intervals.
3. Append the modified new interval and the remaining intervals from the list to the result.
