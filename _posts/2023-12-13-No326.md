### Problem Statement
**link:**

[LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/power-of-three/)

Given an integer n, return true if it is a power of three. Otherwise, return false.

An integer n is a power of three, if there exists an integer x such that n == 3x.

 
**Example:**

**Input:** `n = 27`
**Output:** `true`
 
**Input:** `n = 0`
**Output:** `false`

**Input:** `n = -1`
**Output:** `false`

### Solution Approach

The solution approach checks whether the given integer is a power of three by iteratively dividing it by 3 until it becomes 1, and returns true if it reaches 1, indicating that it is a power of three; otherwise, it returns false.

#### Algorithm
1. If n is 0, return False.
2. While n is divisible by 3, repeatedly divide n by 3.
3. Return True if n is equal to 1 after the division; otherwise, return False.
