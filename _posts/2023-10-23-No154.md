### Problem Statement
**link:**

https://leetcode.cn/problems/find-minimum-in-rotated-sorted-array-ii/
 
Suppose an array of length n sorted in ascending order is rotated between 1 and n times. For example, the array nums = [0,1,4,4,5,6,7] might become:

[4,5,6,7,0,1,4] if it was rotated 4 times.
[0,1,4,4,5,6,7] if it was rotated 7 times.
Notice that rotating an array `[a[0], a[1], a[2], ..., a[n-1]]` 1 time results in the array` [a[n-1], a[0], a[1], a[2], ..., a[n-2]]`.

Given the sorted rotated array nums that may contain duplicates, return the minimum element of this array.

You must decrease the overall operation steps as much as possible.
**Example:**

**Input:** `nums = [1,3,5]`
**Output:** `1`
 
**Input:** `nums = [2,2,2,0,1]`
**Output:** `0`
 

### Solution Approach
The solution efficiently identifies the minimum element using modified binary search tailored for rotated arrays.

#### Algorithm
1. Initialization: Set pointers l and r to the start and end of the array.
2. Midpoint Evaluation: Check the middle of the array; if it's less than the rightmost value, the smallest value is in the left half; if it's greater, the smallest value is in the right half.
3. Handling Duplicates: If the middle value equals the rightmost value, it's not clear which half of the array the minimum is in. Decrement the right pointer and continue the search.
