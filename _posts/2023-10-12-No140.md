### Problem Statement
**link:**
https://leetcode.com/problems/word-break-ii/
https://leetcode.cn/problems/word-break-ii/
 
Given a string s and a dictionary of strings wordDict, add spaces in s to construct a sentence where each word is a valid dictionary word. Return all such possible sentences in any order.

Note that the same word in the dictionary may be reused multiple times in the segmentation.
 

**Example:**

**Input:** `s = "catsanddog", wordDict = ["cat","cats","and","sand","dog"]`
**Output:** `["cats and dog","cat sand dog"]`
 
**Input:** `s = "pineapplepenapple", wordDict = ["apple","pen","applepen","pine","pineapple"]`
**Output:** `["pine apple pen apple","pineapple pen apple","pine applepen apple"]`
 
**Input:** `s = "catsandog", wordDict = ["cats","dog","sand","and","cat"]`
**Output:** `[]`
 
### Solution Approach
Use backtracking combined with memoization to explore possible word breaks and avoid redundant computations.

#### Algorithm
1. DFS with Memoization: Start from the first character and explore word breaks. Use memoization to store results for subproblems to avoid repeated calculations.
2. Prefix Exploration: At each step, check if the current prefix is in the dictionary. If yes, move forward and explore subsequent word breaks.
3. Result Construction: Once a valid word is found, it's appended to the current result. The memo table helps retrieve previously computed results for the rest of the string.
