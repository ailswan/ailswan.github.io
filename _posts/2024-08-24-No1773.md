### Problem Statement
**link:**

[LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/largest-plus-sign/)
You are given an array items, where each items[i] = [typei, colori, namei] describes the type, color, and name of the ith item. You are also given a rule represented by two strings, ruleKey and ruleValue.

The ith item is said to match the rule if one of the following is true:

ruleKey == "type" and ruleValue == typei.
ruleKey == "color" and ruleValue == colori.
ruleKey == "name" and ruleValue == namei.
Return the number of items that match the given rule.

**Example:**

**Input:** `items = [["phone","blue","pixel"],["computer","silver","lenovo"],["phone","gold","iphone"]], ruleKey = "color", ruleValue = "silver"`
**Output:** `1`

**Input:** `items = [["phone","blue","pixel"],["computer","silver","phone"],["phone","gold","iphone"]], ruleKey = "type", ruleValue = "phone"`
**Output:** `2`


**Constraints:**
1 <= items.length <= 104
1 <= typei.length, colori.length, namei.length, ruleValue.length <= 10
ruleKey is equal to either "type", "color", or "name".
All strings consist only of lowercase letters.
