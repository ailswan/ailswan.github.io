### Problem Statement
**link:**
[LeetCode.cn](https://leetcode.cn/problems/longest-increasing-path-in-a-matrix/)
[LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-increasing-path-in-a-matrix/)

Given an m x n integers matrix, return the length of the longest increasing path in matrix.

From each cell, you can either move in four directions: left, right, up, or down. You may not move diagonally or move outside the boundary (i.e., wrap-around is not allowed).
 
**Example:**

**Input:** `matrix = [[9,9,4],[6,6,8],[2,1,1]]`
**Output:** `4`
 
**Input:** `matrix = [[3,4,5],[3,2,6],[2,2,1]]`
**Output:** `4`

**Input:** `matrix = [[1]]`
**Output:** `1`

### Solution Approach

The solution utilizes depth-first search (DFS) combined with memoization to recursively explore and compute the length of the longest increasing path starting from each cell in the matrix.

#### Algorithm
1. DFS with Memoization: Utilizes depth-first search with memoization to compute the length of increasing paths starting from each cell.

2. Recursive Exploration: Recursively explores adjacent cells with values greater than the current cell, moving in four directions (up, down, left, right).

3. Maximum Length: Determines the maximum length among all computed paths, representing the longest increasing path in the matrix.
