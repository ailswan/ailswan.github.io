### Problem Statement

[LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-increasing-path-in-a-matrix/)

Given an m x n integers matrix, return the length of the longest increasing path in matrix.

From each cell, you can either move in four directions: left, right, up, or down. You may not move diagonally or move outside the boundary (i.e., wrap-around is not allowed).
 
**Example:**

**Input:** `matrix = [[9,9,4],[6,6,8],[2,1,1]]`
**Output:** `4`
 
**Input:** `matrix = [[3,4,5],[3,2,6],[2,2,1]]`
**Output:** `4`

**Input:** `matrix = [[1]]`
**Output:** `1`
