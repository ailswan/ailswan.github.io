### Problem Statement

https://leetcode.com/problems/jump-game-iii/description/
 
Given an array of non-negative integers arr, you are initially positioned at start index of the array. When you are at index i, you can jump to i + arr[i] or i - arr[i], check if you can reach any index with value 0.

Notice that you can not jump outside of the array at any time.

**Example:**

**Input:** `arr = [4,2,3,0,3,1,2], start = 5`
**Output:** `true`
 
**Input:** `arr = [4,2,3,0,3,1,2], start = 0`
**Output:** `true`

### Solution Approach
The solution utilizes a Breadth-First Search (BFS) approach to explore possible jumps from the given starting index, keeping track of visited indices and checking if any index with value 0 is reachable.

#### Algorithm
1. Initialization: Create a queue with the starting index, initialize a set for visited indices, and get the array length.
2. BFS Traversal: While the queue is not empty, explore possible jumps from the current index, checking for reachability and updating the visited set.
3. Target Check: If an index with value 0 is encountered during the traversal, return True, indicating reachability.
4. Completion: If the queue is empty and no target is found, return False, signifying that no index with value 0 is reachable.
