### Problem Statement
**link:**
[LeetCode.cn](https://leetcode.cn/problems/maximum-swap/)
[LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/maximum-swap/)
You are given an integer num. You can swap two digits at most once to get the maximum valued number.

Return the maximum valued number you can get.


**Example:**

**Input:** `num = 2736`
**Output:** `7236`

**Input:** `num = 9973`
**Output:** `9973`

**Constraints:**
0 <= num <= 108
 
### Solution Approach
The algorithm identifies the leftmost pair of digits where a swap increases the number's value, then performs the swap to maximize the number.

#### Algorithm
1. Track Maximum Digits: Traverse the number from right to left, keeping track of the maximum digit encountered and its position.
2. Identify Swap Opportunity: While traversing, identify the first position where the current digit is smaller than the maximum digit found later in the sequence.
3. Perform the Swap: Swap the identified smaller digit with the maximum digit to form the largest possible number. If no swap opportunity is found, return the original number.
