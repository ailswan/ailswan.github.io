### Problem Statement
**link:**
[LeetCode.cn](https://leetcode.cn/problems/closest-binary-search-tree-value/)
[LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/closest-binary-search-tree-value/)

Given the root of a binary search tree and a target value, return the value in the BST that is closest to the target. If there are multiple answers, print the smallest.

 
**Example:**

**Input:** `root = [4,2,5,1,3], target = 3.714286`
**Output:** `4`
 
**Input:** `root = [1], target = 4.428571`
**Output:** `1`

### Solution Approach
In this problem, we aim to find the value in a binary search tree (BST) that is closest to a given target. The solution approach involves traversing the BST while keeping track of the closest value to the target.

#### Algorithm
1. Initialization: Start with the root node and initialize variables to track the closest value and its absolute difference from the target.
2. Traverse and Update: Traverse the BST while updating the closest value based on the absolute difference at each step.
3. Return Result: After the traversal, return the identified closest value to the target, considering any multiple answers and prioritizing the smallest value.
