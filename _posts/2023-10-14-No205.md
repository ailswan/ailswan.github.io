### Problem Statement
**link:**
https://leetcode.com/problems/isomorphic-strings/
https://leetcode.cn/problems/isomorphic-strings/
 
Given two strings s and t, determine if they are isomorphic.

Two strings s and t are isomorphic if the characters in s can be replaced to get t.

All occurrences of a character must be replaced with another character while preserving the order of characters. No two characters may map to the same character, but a character may map to itself.


**Example:**

**Input:** `s = "egg", t = "add"`
**Output:** `true`
 
**Input:** `s = "foo", t = "bar"`
**Output:** `false`
 
**Input:** `s = "paper", t = "title"`
**Output:** `true`

### Solution Approach
To determine if two strings are isomorphic, ensure a one-to-one mapping between their characters without any overlaps.

#### Algorithm
1. Length Check: Ensure both strings have equal lengths.
2. Map Characters: Utilize a dictionary to relate characters from s to t, and a set to note which characters from t are already mapped.
3. Verify Mapping: For each character in s, ensure it maps uniquely to a character in t. If all mappings are consistent, the strings are isomorphic.
