### Problem Statement
**link:**
https://leetcode.com/problems/isomorphic-strings/
https://leetcode.cn/problems/isomorphic-strings/
 
Given two strings s and t, determine if they are isomorphic.

Two strings s and t are isomorphic if the characters in s can be replaced to get t.

All occurrences of a character must be replaced with another character while preserving the order of characters. No two characters may map to the same character, but a character may map to itself.


**Example:**

**Input:** `s = "egg", t = "add"`
**Output:** `true`
 
**Input:** `s = "foo", t = "bar"`
**Output:** `false`
 
**Input:** `s = "paper", t = "title"`
**Output:** `true`
