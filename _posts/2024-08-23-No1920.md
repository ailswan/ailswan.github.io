### Problem Statement
**link:**
[LeetCode.cn](https://leetcode.cn/problems/build-array-from-permutation/)
[LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/build-array-from-permutation/)
Given a zero-based permutation nums (0-indexed), build an array ans of the same length where ans[i] = nums[nums[i]] for each 0 <= i < nums.length and return it.

A zero-based permutation nums is an array of distinct integers from 0 to nums.length - 1 (inclusive).

**Example:**

**Input:** `nums = [0,2,1,5,3,4]`
**Output:** `[0,1,2,4,5,3]`

**Input:** `nums = [5,0,1,2,3,4]`
**Output:** `[4,5,0,1,2,3]`

**Constraints:**
1 <= nums.length <= 1000
0 <= nums[i] < nums.length
The elements in nums are distinct.

Follow-up: Can you solve it without using an extra space (i.e., O(1) memory)?

### Solution Approach
To build the array ans from the permutation nums, update each element in nums by combining the current value and the value at the index specified by nums[i], and then extract the result by dividing each element by 1000.

#### Algorithm
1. Update Elements: Modify each element nums[i] to include both the current value and the value from nums[nums[i]], using a scaling factor (e.g., 1000) to keep both values in the same element.
2. Extract Result: Divide each modified element by the scaling factor to retrieve the desired values from nums[nums[i]].
3. Preserve Original Values: Ensure that the initial values of nums are preserved during the update phase so that the final extraction is accurate.
#### Complexity
 **time complexity**: O(n)
 **space complexity**: O(1)
