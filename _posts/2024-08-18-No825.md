    class Solution:
        def numFriendRequests(self, ages: List[int]) -> int:
            # Count the number of people for each age from 0 to 120
            cnt = [0] * 121
            for age in ages:
                cnt[age] += 1
            
            # Calculate the cumulative number of people up to each age
            pre = [0] * 121
            for i in range(1, 121):
                pre[i] = pre[i - 1] + cnt[i]
            
            ans = 0
            # Iterate through possible ages from 15 to 120
            for i in range(15, 121):
                if cnt[i] > 0:
                    # Calculate the lower bound for the age of the person who can receive a friend request
                    bound = int(i * 0.5 + 7)
                    # Calculate the number of valid friend requests for the current age
                    ans += cnt[i] * (pre[i] - pre[bound] - 1)

### Problem Statement
**link:**
[LeetCode.cn](https://leetcode.cn/problems/friends-of-appropriate-ages/)
[LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/friends-of-appropriate-ages/)
There are n persons on a social media website. You are given an integer array ages where ages[i] is the age of the ith person.

A Person x will not send a friend request to a person y (x != y) if any of the following conditions is true:

age[y] <= 0.5 * age[x] + 7
age[y] > age[x]
age[y] > 100 && age[x] < 100
Otherwise, x will send a friend request to y.

Note that if x sends a request to y, y will not necessarily send a request to x. Also, a person will not send a friend request to themself.

Return the total number of friend requests made.

 
**Example:**

**Input:** `ages = [16,16]`
**Output:** `2`

**Input:** `ages = [16,17,18]`
**Output:** `2`

**Constraints:**
n == ages.length
1 <= n <= 2 * 104
1 <= ages[i] <= 120
 
### Solution Approach
The solution uses counting and prefix sums to efficiently calculate the total number of valid friend requests by checking age-related conditions for each person.

#### Algorithm
1. Counting Age Frequency: Use a frequency array to count the occurrences of each age, which allows efficient calculation of potential friend requests.
2. Prefix Sum Calculation: Create a prefix sum array to quickly determine the cumulative number of people with ages less than or equal to a given age, aiding in range queries.
3. Range-based Friend Requests: Iterate through possible ages and calculate valid friend requests using the conditions, subtracting inappropriate requests using the prefix sum array.
