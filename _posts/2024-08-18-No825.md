[LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/friends-of-appropriate-ages/)
There are n persons on a social media website. You are given an integer array ages where ages[i] is the age of the ith person.

A Person x will not send a friend request to a person y (x != y) if any of the following conditions is true:

age[y] <= 0.5 * age[x] + 7
age[y] > age[x]
age[y] > 100 && age[x] < 100
Otherwise, x will send a friend request to y.

Note that if x sends a request to y, y will not necessarily send a request to x. Also, a person will not send a friend request to themself.

Return the total number of friend requests made.

 
**Example:**

**Input:** `ages = [16,16]`
**Output:** `2`

**Input:** `ages = [16,17,18]`
**Output:** `2`

**Constraints:**
n == ages.length
1 <= n <= 2 * 104
1 <= ages[i] <= 120
