### Problem Statement
**link:**
https://leetcode.com/problems/sum-root-to-leaf-numbers/
https://leetcode.cn/problems/sum-root-to-leaf-numbers/

You are given the root of a binary tree containing digits from 0 to 9 only.

Each root-to-leaf path in the tree represents a number.

For example, the root-to-leaf path 1 -> 2 -> 3 represents the number 123.
Return the total sum of all root-to-leaf numbers. Test cases are generated so that the answer will fit in a 32-bit integer.

A leaf node is a node with no children.

**Example:**

**Input:** `root = [1,2,3]`
**Output:** `25`
 
**Input:** `root = [4,9,0,5,1]`
**Output:** `1026`
 

### Solution Approach
The solution leverages depth-first traversal to construct and sum numbers from the root to each leaf.
 
#### Algorithm
1. Initialization: Begin with a running total n as we traverse from the root.
2. DFS with Accumulation: For each node, modify the current number (n = n * 10 + node.val) and recursively traverse left and right children.
3. Leaf Check: At a leaf (no children), return the current path's number. If not a leaf, return the combined sum from both subtrees.
4. Final Sum: The initial function call yields the sum of all root-to-leaf numbers.
