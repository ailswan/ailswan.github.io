### Problem Statement
**link:**

[LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/increasing-triplet-subsequence/)

Given an integer array nums, return true if there exists a triple of indices (i, j, k) such that i < j < k and nums[i] < nums[j] < nums[k]. If no such indices exists, return false.
 
**Example:**

**Input:** `nums = [1,2,3,4,5]`
**Output:** `true`
 
**Input:** `nums = [5,4,3,2,1]`
**Output:** `false`

**Input:** `nums = [2,1,5,0,4,6]`
**Output:** `true`

### Solution Approach
The solution employs a greedy approach to find an increasing triplet subsequence in the given array nums.

#### Algorithm
1. Initialization: Initialize two variables first and second to positive infinity.

2. Finding Triplet: Iterate through each element n in the array.

-If n is less than or equal to first, update first to n.
-Otherwise, if n is less than or equal to second, update second to n.
-If none of the above conditions are met, return True as an increasing triplet subsequence (i.e., first, second, and n) has been found.
3. No Triplet Found: If the loop completes without finding an increasing triplet subsequence, return False.
