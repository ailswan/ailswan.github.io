### Problem Statement
**link:**
[LeetCode.cn](https://leetcode.cn/problems/palindrome-linked-list/)
[LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/palindrome-linked-list/)
Given the head of a singly linked list, return true if it is a palindrome or false otherwise.
**Example:**

**Input:** `head = [1,2,2,1]`
**Output:** `true`

**Input:** `head = [1,2]`
**Output:** `false`

**Constraints:**
The number of nodes in the list is in the range [1, 105].
0 <= Node.val <= 9
 
### Follow up: Could you do it in O(n) time and O(1) space?

### Solution Approach
The solution involves finding the middle of the linked list, reversing the second half, and then comparing it with the first half to check if the list is a palindrome.

#### Algorithm
1. Find the Middle: Use the slow and fast pointer technique to find the middle of the linked list.
2. Reverse the Second Half: Reverse the second half of the linked list starting from the middle.
3. Compare Halves: Compare the first half and the reversed second half of the list to determine if they are identical, confirming if the linked list is a palindrome.
