### Problem Statement
**link:**

https://leetcode.cn/problems/validate-binary-search-tree/


Given the root of a binary tree, determine if it is a valid binary search tree (BST).

A valid BST is defined as follows:

The left 
subtree
 of a node contains only nodes with keys less than the node's key.
The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys greater than the node's key.
Both the left and right subtrees must also be binary search trees.

**Example:**

**Input:** `root = [2,1,3]`
**Output:** `true`
 
**Input:** `root = [5,1,4,null,null,3,6]`
**Output:** `false`
