### Problem Statement
**link:**
https://leetcode.com/problems/unique-paths/
https://leetcode.cn/problems/unique-paths/

There is a robot on an m x n grid. The robot is initially located at the top-left corner (i.e., grid[0][0]). The robot tries to move to the bottom-right corner (i.e., grid[m - 1][n - 1]). The robot can only move either down or right at any point in time.

Given the two integers m and n, return the number of possible unique paths that the robot can take to reach the bottom-right corner.

The test cases are generated so that the answer will be less than or equal to 2 * 109.

**Example:**

**Input:** `m = 3, n = 7`
**Output:** `28`

**Input:** `m = 3, n = 2`
**Output:** `3`
