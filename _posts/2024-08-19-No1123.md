### Problem Statement
**link:**

[LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/lowest-common-ancestor-of-deepest-leaves/)
Given the root of a binary tree, return the lowest common ancestor of its deepest leaves.

Recall that:

The node of a binary tree is a leaf if and only if it has no children
The depth of the root of the tree is 0. if the depth of a node is d, the depth of each of its children is d + 1.
The lowest common ancestor of a set S of nodes, is the node A with the largest depth such that every node in S is in the subtree with root A.

**Example:**

**Input:** `root = [3,5,1,6,2,0,8,null,null,7,4]`
**Output:** `[2,7,4]`

**Input:** `root = [1]`
**Output:** `[1]`

**Input:** `root = [0,1,3,null,2]`
**Output:** `[2]`

**Constraints:**
The number of nodes in the tree will be in the range [1, 1000].
0 <= Node.val <= 1000
The values of the nodes in the tree are unique.
