### Problem Statement
**link:**
[LeetCode.cn](https://leetcode.cn/problems/shortest-subarray-with-or-at-least-k-i/)
[LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/shortest-subarray-with-or-at-least-k-i/)
You are given a 0-indexed integer array nums. An index i is part of a hill in nums if the closest non-equal neighbors of i are smaller than nums[i]. Similarly, an index i is part of a valley in nums if the closest non-equal neighbors of i are larger than nums[i]. Adjacent indices i and j are part of the same hill or valley if nums[i] == nums[j].

Note that for an index to be part of a hill or valley, it must have a non-equal neighbor on both the left and right of the index.

Return the number of hills and valleys in nums.

**Example:**

**Input:** `nums = [2,4,1,1,6,5]`
**Output:** `3`

**Input:** `nums = [6,6,5,5,4,1]`
**Output:** `0`

**Input:** `nums = [1,2], k = 0`
**Output:** `1`


**Constraints:**
3 <= nums.length <= 100
1 <= nums[i] <= 100

### Solution Approach
The solution iterates through the array, skipping equal adjacent values, and checks if each element forms a hill or valley by comparing it to its nearest non-equal neighbors, then counts the valid hills and valleys.

#### Algorithm
1. Skip Equal Adjacent Values: The algorithm skips consecutive equal elements to avoid redundant checks and focus on potential hill or valley points.
2. Compare Neighbors: For each potential hill or valley, the algorithm compares it to its nearest non-equal neighbors on both sides to determine if it's a hill (greater than both neighbors) or a valley (less than both neighbors).
3. Count Valid Hills and Valleys: The algorithm counts each index that satisfies the hill or valley conditions and returns the total count.
#### Complexity
 **time complexity**: O(n^2)
 **space complexity**: O(1)
