### Problem Statement
**link:**
https://leetcode.com/problems/single-number-ii/
https://leetcode.cn/problems/single-number-ii/

Given an integer array nums where every element appears three times except for one, which appears exactly once. Find the single element and return it.

You must implement a solution with a linear runtime complexity and use only constant extra space. 

**Example:**

**Input:** `nums = [2,2,3,2]`
**Output:** `3`
 
**Input:** `nums = [0,1,0,1,0,1,99]`
**Output:** `99`
 

### Solution Approach
Leverage bitwise manipulation to track occurrence of each bit across all numbers.

#### Algorithm
**Approach1**
Using the property of sets, calculate the difference between the sum of unique numbers (multiplied by 3) and the sum of the original list. Dividing this difference by 2 reveals the single number.
**Approach2**
For each bit position in a 32-bit integer, count the number of ones. If the count isn't divisible by 3, the unique number contributes to that bit. Construct the result based on these contributing bits.
