### Problem Statement
**link:**
[LeetCode.cn](https://leetcode.cn/problems/shortest-path-in-binary-matrix/)
[LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/shortest-path-in-binary-matrix/)
Given an n x n binary matrix grid, return the length of the shortest clear path in the matrix. If there is no clear path, return -1.

A clear path in a binary matrix is a path from the top-left cell (i.e., (0, 0)) to the bottom-right cell (i.e., (n - 1, n - 1)) such that:

All the visited cells of the path are 0.
All the adjacent cells of the path are 8-directionally connected (i.e., they are different and they share an edge or a corner).
The length of a clear path is the number of visited cells of this path.

**Example:**

**Input:** `grid = [[0,1],[1,0]]`
**Output:** `2`

**Input:** `grid = [[0,0,0],[1,1,0],[1,1,0]]`
**Output:** `4`

**Input:** `grid = [[1,0,0],[1,1,0],[1,1,0]]`
**Output:** `-1`

**Constraints:**
n == grid.length
n == grid[i].length
1 <= n <= 100
grid[i][j] is 0 or 1

### Solution Approach
The solution uses BFS to explore the matrix from the top-left to the bottom-right cell, updating distances and checking valid moves to find the shortest clear path. If the end cell is reached, the path length is returned; otherwise, -1 is returned if no path exists.
#### Algorithm
1. Breadth-First Search (BFS) Approach: The algorithm uses BFS to explore the matrix level-by-level, ensuring that the shortest path is found if it exists.
2. 8-Directional Movement: The BFS explores all 8 possible directions (horizontal, vertical, and diagonal) from each cell to find the shortest path to the bottom-right corner.
3. Matrix Update and Queue Management: The matrix cells are updated to mark them as visited, and a queue is used to manage the BFS traversal, with each cell’s distance from the start being tracked.

#### Complexity
 **time complexity**: O(n^2)
 **space complexity**: O(n^2)
