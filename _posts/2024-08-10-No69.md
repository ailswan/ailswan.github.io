### Problem Statement
**link:**
[LeetCode.cn](https://leetcode.cn/problems/sqrtx/)
[LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/sqrtx/)
Given a non-negative integer x, return the square root of x rounded down to the nearest integer. The returned integer should be non-negative as well.

You must not use any built-in exponent function or operator.

For example, do not use pow(x, 0.5) in c++ or x ** 0.5 in python.
 
**Example:**

**Input:** `x = 4`
**Output:** `2`

**Input:** `x = 8`
**Output:** `2`

**Constraints:**
0 <= x <= 231 - 1

### Solution Approach
Use binary search to find the square root by narrowing the range of possible values until the closest integer is found.

#### Algorithm
1. Set Search Range: Start with left at 0 and right at x to cover all possible square root values.
2. Binary Search: Repeatedly check the midpoint. If its square is too high, move the right boundary; if too low, move the left boundary and save the midpoint as a potential answer.
3. Return Closest: Once the search range is exhausted, return the last midpoint that didn't exceed x.
