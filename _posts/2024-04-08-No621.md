### Problem Statement
**link:**
[LeetCode.cn](https://leetcode.cn/problems/task-scheduler//)
[LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/task-scheduler//)
You are given an array of CPU tasks, each represented by letters A to Z, and a cooling time, n. Each cycle or interval allows the completion of one task. Tasks can be completed in any order, but there's a constraint: identical tasks must be separated by at least n intervals due to cooling time.

​Return the minimum number of intervals required to complete all tasks.


**Example:**

**Input:** `tasks = ["A","A","A","B","B","B"], n = 2`
**Output:** `8`

**Input:** `tasks = ["A","C","A","B","D","B"], n = 1`
**Output:** `6`
 
 
### Solution Approach

The algorithm calculates the minimum number of intervals required by determining the maximum frequency of tasks and distributing them with cooling intervals between identical tasks.

#### Algorithm
1. Calculate Task Frequencies: Use a counter to calculate the frequencies of each task in the input array.
2. Identify Maximum Frequency: Find the task with the maximum frequency and determine how many tasks share this maximum frequency.
3. Calculate Minimum Intervals: Compute the minimum number of intervals required by distributing the tasks with cooling intervals between identical tasks, considering the maximum frequency and the cooling time.
