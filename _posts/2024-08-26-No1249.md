### Problem Statement
**link:**

https://leetcode.cn/problems/minimum-remove-to-make-valid-parentheses/
 
Given a string s of '(' , ')' and lowercase English characters.

Your task is to remove the minimum number of parentheses ( '(' or ')', in any positions ) so that the resulting parentheses string is valid and return any valid string.

Formally, a parentheses string is valid if and only if:

It is the empty string, contains only lowercase characters, or
It can be written as AB (A concatenated with B), where A and B are valid strings, or
It can be written as (A), where A is a valid string.

**Example:**

**Input:** `s = "lee(t(c)o)de)"`
**Output:** `"lee(t(c)o)de"`
 
**Input:** `s = "a)b(c)d"`
**Output:** `"ab(c)d"`
 
**Input:** `s = "))(("`
**Output:** `""`

Constraints:

1 <= s.length <= 10^5
s[i] is either '(' , ')', or lowercase English letter.

### Solution Approach

The algorithm uses a stack-based approach to balance parentheses by first ensuring that all open parentheses have a matching closing parenthesis, and then removing any extra open parentheses left unmatche

#### Algorithm
1. Stack-Based Processing: The solution uses a stack-like approach to ensure that every closing parenthesis ) has a matching opening parenthesis ( by keeping track of unmatched parentheses and adding characters to a result list accordingly.
2. Two-Pass Approach: The algorithm performs two passes through the string: the first pass builds the intermediate result while balancing parentheses, and the second pass removes any unmatched opening parentheses from the end of the result list.
3. Efficient Handling: By iterating through the string only twice and using a single list for results, the solution achieves a time complexity of O(N) and a space complexity of O(N), making it efficient for large input sizes.
#### Complexity
 **time complexity**: O(n)
 **space complexity**: O(n)
