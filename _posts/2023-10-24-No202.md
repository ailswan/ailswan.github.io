### Problem Statement
**link:**

https://leetcode.cn/problems/happy-number/
 
Write an algorithm to determine if a number n is happy.

A happy number is a number defined by the following process:

Starting with any positive integer, replace the number by the sum of the squares of its digits.
Repeat the process until the number equals 1 (where it will stay), or it loops endlessly in a cycle which does not include 1.
Those numbers for which this process ends in 1 are happy.
Return true if n is a happy number, and false if not.


**Example:**

**Input:** `n = 19`
**Output:** `true`
 
**Input:** `n = 2`
**Output:** `false`
