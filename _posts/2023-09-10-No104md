Given the root of a binary tree, return its maximum depth.

A binary tree's maximum depth is the number of nodes along the longest path from the root node down to the farthest leaf node.


**Example:**

**Input:** `root = [3,9,20,null,null,15,7]`
**Output:** `3`
 
**Input:** `root = [1,null,2]`
**Output:** `2`
