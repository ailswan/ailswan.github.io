    class KthLargest:
    def __init__(self, k: int, nums: List[int]):
        self.k = k
        self.nums = nums
        self.nums.sort()

    def add(self, val: int) -> int:
        l, r = 0, len(self.nums) - 1
        while l <= r:
            m = l + (r - l) // 2
            if self.nums[m] < val:
                l = m + 1
            else:

        self.nums.insert(l, val)
        return self.nums[-self.k]

    # def __init__(self, k: int, nums: List[int]):
    #     self.k = k
    #     self.nums = sorted(nums)

    # def add(self, val: int) -> int:
    #     insert_position = bisect.bisect_left(self.nums, val)
    #     self.nums.insert(insert_position, val)
    #     return self.nums[-self.k]



# Your KthLargest object will be instantiated and called as such:
# obj = KthLargest(k, nums)
# param_1 = obj.add(val)

### Problem Statement
**link:**
[LeetCode.cn](https://leetcode.cn/problems/kth-largest-element-in-a-stream/)
[LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/kth-largest-element-in-a-stream/)
Design a class to find the kth largest element in a stream. Note that it is the kth largest element in the sorted order, not the kth distinct element.

Implement KthLargest class:

KthLargest(int k, int[] nums) Initializes the object with the integer k and the stream of integers nums.
int add(int val) Appends the integer val to the stream and returns the element representing the kth largest element in the stream.


**Example:**

**Input:** `["KthLargest", "add", "add", "add", "add", "add"][[3, [4, 5, 8, 2]], [3], [5], [10], [9], [4]]`
**Output:** `[null, 4, 5, 5, 8, 8]`

**Constraints:**
1 <= k <= 104
0 <= nums.length <= 104
-104 <= nums[i] <= 104
-104 <= val <= 104
At most 104 calls will be made to add.
It is guaranteed that there will be at least k elements in the array when you search for the kth element.
 
### Solution Approach
This solution involves maintaining a sorted list of elements, where each new element is inserted at the correct position using binary search, allowing efficient retrieval of the kth largest element in the stream.

#### Algorithm
1. Maintain Sorted Order: The list is kept sorted at all times by inserting each new value in the correct position using binary search.
2. Insert Efficiently: Use binary search (bisect_left) to determine the correct insertion point for the new value, ensuring that the list remains sorted.
3. Retrieve kth Largest: After inserting a new value, the kth largest element is always at index -self.k in the sorted list, providing efficient access to the desired element.
