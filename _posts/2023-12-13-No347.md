### Problem Statement
**link:**

[LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/top-k-frequent-elements/)

Given an integer array nums and an integer k, return the k most frequent elements. You may return the answer in any order.
 
**Example:**

**Input:** `nums = [1,1,1,2,2,3], k = 2`
**Output:** `[1,2]`
 
**Input:** `nums = [1], k = 1`
**Output:** `[1]`

### Solution Approach
The solution utilizes a Counter to count the frequency of elements in the input list, then employs heapq.nlargest to extract the k most frequent elements based on their counts.

#### Algorithm
1. Count Frequency: Use a Counter to tally the frequency of each element in the input list.

2. Extract Top K Elements: Utilize heapq.nlargest() to retrieve the k elements with the highest frequencies from the Counter.

3. Return Result: Return the obtained k most frequent elements.
