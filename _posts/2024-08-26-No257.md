### Problem Statement
**link:**
https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-tree-paths/
https://leetcode.cn/problems/binary-tree-paths/
 
Given the root of a binary tree, return all root-to-leaf paths in any order.

A leaf is a node with no children.

**Example:**

**Input:** `root = [1,2,3,null,5]`
**Output:** `["1->2->5","1->3"]`
 
**Input:** `root = [1]`
**Output:** `["1"]`
 

### Solution Approach
The algorithm uses a depth-first search (DFS) approach with a stack to explore all paths from the root to the leaves, building paths as it traverses the tree.

#### Algorithm
1. Depth-First Search (DFS): The algorithm uses DFS to traverse the tree, exploring as far down a branch as possible before backtracking.
2. Stack for Path Tracking: It employs two stacks—one for nodes and another for paths—to keep track of the current node and the path leading to it.
3. Path Construction: For each leaf node encountered, the algorithm constructs the complete path from the root to that leaf and adds it to the result list.

#### Complexity
 **time complexity**: O(n)
 **space complexity**: O(n)
