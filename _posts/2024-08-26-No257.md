### Problem Statement
**link:**
https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-linked-list/
https://leetcode.cn/problems/reverse-linked-list/
 
Given the head of a singly linked list, reverse the list, and return the reversed list.

**Example:**

**Input:** `head = [1,2,3,4,5]`
**Output:** `[5,4,3,2,1]`
 
**Input:** `head = [1,2]`
**Output:** `[2,1]`
 
**Input:** `head = []`
**Output:** `[]`

### Solution Approach
To reverse a linked list, iteratively reassign the next pointers while traversing the list.

#### Algorithm
Initialization: Create a dummy node initialized to None, which will eventually be the new head of the reversed list.
Reassign Pointers: For each node in the list, starting from head, update its next pointer to point to dummy, effectively reversing its direction.
Traversal: Move the current node to the next node in the original list and repeat step 2 until the entire list is reversed.
