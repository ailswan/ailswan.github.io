[LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/intersection-of-three-sorted-arrays/)
Given three integer arrays arr1, arr2 and arr3 sorted in strictly increasing order, return a sorted array of only the integers that appeared in all three arrays.

**Example:**

**Input:** `arr1 = [1,2,3,4,5], arr2 = [1,2,5,7,9], arr3 = [1,3,4,5,8]`
**Output:** `[1,5]`

**Input:** `arr1 = [197,418,523,876,1356], arr2 = [501,880,1593,1710,1870], arr3 = [521,682,1337,1395,1764]`
**Output:** `[]`

**Constraints:**
1 <= arr1.length, arr2.length, arr3.length <= 1000
1 <= arr1[i], arr2[i], arr3[i] <= 2000
