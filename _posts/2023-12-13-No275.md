[LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/h-index-ii/)

Given an array of integers citations where citations[i] is the number of citations a researcher received for their ith paper and citations is sorted in ascending order, return the researcher's h-index.

According to the definition of h-index on Wikipedia: The h-index is defined as the maximum value of h such that the given researcher has published at least h papers that have each been cited at least h times.

You must write an algorithm that runs in logarithmic time.
 
**Example:**

**Input:** `citations = [0,1,3,5,6]`
**Output:** `3`
 
**Input:** `citations = [1,2,100]`
**Output:** `2`
