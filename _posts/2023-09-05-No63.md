### Problem Statement

https://leetcode.cn/problems/unique-paths-ii/

You are given an m x n integer array grid. There is a robot initially located at the top-left corner (i.e., grid[0][0]). The robot tries to move to the bottom-right corner (i.e., grid[m - 1][n - 1]). The robot can only move either down or right at any point in time.

An obstacle and space are marked as 1 or 0 respectively in grid. A path that the robot takes cannot include any square that is an obstacle.

Return the number of possible unique paths that the robot can take to reach the bottom-right corner.

The testcases are generated so that the answer will be less than or equal to 2 * 109.

**Example:**

**Input:** `obstacleGrid = [[0,0,0],[0,1,0],[0,0,0]]`
**Output:** `2`

**Input:** `obstacleGrid = [[0,1],[0,0]]`
**Output:** `1`
