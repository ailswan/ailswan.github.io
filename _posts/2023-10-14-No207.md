https://leetcode.cn/problems/course-schedule/
 
There are a total of numCourses courses you have to take, labeled from 0 to numCourses - 1. You are given an array prerequisites where prerequisites[i] = [ai, bi] indicates that you must take course bi first if you want to take course ai.

For example, the pair [0, 1], indicates that to take course 0 you have to first take course 1.
Return true if you can finish all courses. Otherwise, return false.

 

**Example:**

**Input:** `numCourses = 2, prerequisites = [[1,0]]`
**Output:** `true`
 
**Input:** `numCourses = 2, prerequisites = [[1,0],[0,1]]`
