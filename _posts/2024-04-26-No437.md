### Problem Statement
**link:**

[LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/path-sum-iii/)
Given the root of a binary tree and an integer targetSum, return the number of paths where the sum of the values along the path equals targetSum.

The path does not need to start or end at the root or a leaf, but it must go downwards (i.e., traveling only from parent nodes to child nodes).

**Example:**

**Input:** `root = [10,5,-3,3,2,null,11,3,-2,null,1], targetSum = 8`
**Output:** `3`

**Input:** `root = [5,4,8,11,null,13,4,7,2,null,null,5,1], targetSum = 22`
**Output:** `3`
 
### Solution Approach

The solution utilizes depth-first search (DFS) to traverse the binary tree while maintaining a dictionary to track cumulative sums along the paths. It counts the occurrences of sums that meet the target and returns the total count.

#### Algorithm
1. Perform a depth-first search (DFS) traversal of the binary tree.
2. Maintain a dictionary to record cumulative sums along the paths encountered during traversal.
3. Check for the difference between the current sum and the target at each node, adding the count of such differences found in the dictionary to the result.
4. Utilize backtracking to ensure accurate counting as traversal progresses through different branches of the tree.
