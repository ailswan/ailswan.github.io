### Problem Statement
**link:**
https://leetcode.com/problems/best-time-to-buy-and-sell-stock/
https://leetcode.cn/problems/best-time-to-buy-and-sell-stock/

You are given an array prices where prices[i] is the price of a given stock on the ith day.

You want to maximize your profit by choosing a single day to buy one stock and choosing a different day in the future to sell that stock.

Return the maximum profit you can achieve from this transaction. If you cannot achieve any profit, return 0.

**Example:**

**Input:** `prices = [7,1,5,3,6,4]`
**Output:** `5`
 
**Input:** `prices = [7,6,4,3,1]`
**Output:** `0`
 

### Solution Approach
The key to solving this problem lies in finding the minimum price to buy the stock and the corresponding maximum price difference to sell the stock.
 
#### Algorithm
1. Initialize min_buy with the first price.
2. Traverse through prices; if a lower price is found, update min_buy. Otherwise, calculate profit and update max_profit if it's higher.
3. Return max_profit at the end.
