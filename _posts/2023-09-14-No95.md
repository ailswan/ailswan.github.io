### Problem Statement
**link:**

https://leetcode.cn/problems/unique-binary-search-trees-ii/

Given an integer n, return all the structurally unique BST's (binary search trees), which has exactly n nodes of unique values from 1 to n. Return the answer in any order.

**Example:**

**Input:** `n = 3`
**Output:** `[[1,null,2,null,3],[1,null,3,2],[2,1,3],[3,1,null,null,2],[3,2,null,1]]`
 
**Input:** `n = 1`
**Output:** `[[1]]`

### Solution Approach
The solution employs recursion and backtracking to generate all possible combinations of BSTs for a given number of nodes.
 
#### Algorithm
 
1. The gen function recursively calculates possible BST combinations for a given range of values.
2. For each value i in the range, it treats i as a root and recursively generates left and right subtrees using values before and after i, respectively.
3. For every combination of left and right subtrees, a new BST is formed with i as root and added to the list of BSTs for the current range.
