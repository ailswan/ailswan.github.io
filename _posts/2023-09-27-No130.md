https://leetcode.cn/problems/surrounded-regions/

Given an m x n matrix board containing 'X' and 'O', capture all regions that are 4-directionally surrounded by 'X'.

A region is captured by flipping all 'O's into 'X's in that surrounded region.

**Example:**

**Input:** `board = [["X","X","X","X"],["X","O","O","X"],["X","X","O","X"],["X","O","X","X"]]`
**Output:** `[["X","X","X","X"],["X","X","X","X"],["X","X","X","X"],["X","O","X","X"]]`
 
**Input:** `board = [["X"]]`
**Output:** `[["X"]]`
