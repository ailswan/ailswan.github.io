### Problem Statement
**link:**
[LeetCode.cn](https://leetcode.cn/problems/maximum-subsequence-score/)
[LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/maximum-subsequence-score/)
You are given two 0-indexed integer arrays nums1 and nums2 of equal length n and a positive integer k. You must choose a subsequence of indices from nums1 of length k.

For chosen indices i0, i1, ..., ik - 1, your score is defined as:

The sum of the selected elements from nums1 multiplied with the minimum of the selected elements from nums2.
It can defined simply as: (nums1[i0] + nums1[i1] +...+ nums1[ik - 1]) * min(nums2[i0] , nums2[i1], ... ,nums2[ik - 1]).
Return the maximum possible score.

A subsequence of indices of an array is a set that can be derived from the set {0, 1, ..., n-1} by deleting some or no elements.

**Example:**

**Input:** `nums1 = [1,3,3,2], nums2 = [2,1,3,4], k = 3`
**Output:** `12`

**Input:** `nums1 = [4,2,3,1,1], nums2 = [7,5,10,9,6], k = 1`
**Output:** `30`
 
### Solution Approach
To maximize the subsequence score, we sort pairs of elements from nums1 and nums2 by nums2 in descending order, use a heap to track the top k elements from nums1, and dynamically calculate the sum and the product with the current minimum of nums2 values.

#### Algorithm
1. Sorting: Sort pairs of elements from nums1 and nums2 by the values of nums2 in descending order to prioritize larger multipliers.
2. Heap Management: Use a min-heap to maintain the top k elements from nums1 for efficient retrieval and updates as we iterate through the sorted pairs.
3. Dynamic Calculation: Continuously calculate the subsequence sum from the heap and update the maximum possible score by multiplying this sum with the current minimum value from nums2 as we process each pair.
