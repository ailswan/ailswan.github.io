### Problem Statement
**link:**
https://leetcode.com/problems/permutation-sequence/
https://leetcode.cn/problems/permutation-sequence/

The set [1, 2, 3, ..., n] contains a total of n! unique permutations.

By listing and labeling all of the permutations in order, we get the following sequence for n = 3:

"123"
"132"
"213"
"231"
"312"
"321"
Given n and k, return the kth permutation sequence.

**Example:**

**Input:** `n = 3, k = 3`
**Output:** `"213"`

**Input:** `n = 4, k = 9`
**Output:** `"2314"`

**Input:** `n = 3, k = 1`
**Output:** `"123"`
