### Problem Statement
**link:**
[LeetCode.cn](https://leetcode.cn/problems/longest-consecutive-sequence/)
[LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/longest-consecutive-sequence/)
Given an unsorted array of integers nums, return the length of the longest consecutive elements sequence.

You must write an algorithm that runs in O(n) time.
 
**Example:**

**Input:** `nums = [100,4,200,1,3,2]`
**Output:** `4`

**Input:** `nums = [0,3,7,2,5,8,4,6,0,1]`
**Output:** `9`

**Constraints:**
0 <= nums.length <= 105
-109 <= nums[i] <= 109

### Solution Approach
The solution uses a set to efficiently check for consecutive sequences by iterating through each number and extending the sequence while updating the maximum length found.

#### Algorithm
1. Utilize a Set: Store all numbers in a set for O(1) average-time complexity checks to quickly determine if consecutive numbers exist.
2. Identify Sequence Start: For each number, check if it is the start of a sequence by ensuring that n - 1 is not in the set.
3. Extend the Sequence: Once a sequence start is found, extend the sequence by checking if subsequent numbers (n + length) are in the set and keep track of the length of the longest sequence found.
