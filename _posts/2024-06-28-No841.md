### Problem Statement

[LeetCode](https://leetcode.cn/problems/keys-and-rooms/)
There are n rooms labeled from 0 to n - 1 and all the rooms are locked except for room 0. Your goal is to visit all the rooms. However, you cannot enter a locked room without having its key.

When you visit a room, you may find a set of distinct keys in it. Each key has a number on it, denoting which room it unlocks, and you can take all of them with you to unlock the other rooms.

Given an array rooms where rooms[i] is the set of keys that you can obtain if you visited room i, return true if you can visit all the rooms, or false otherwise.

**Example:**

**Input:** `rooms = [[1],[2],[3],[]]`
**Output:** `true`

**Input:** `rooms = [[1,3],[3,0,1],[2],[0]]`
**Output:** `false`
