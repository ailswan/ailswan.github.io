        def maxSubArray(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
            n = len(nums)
            cur = res = nums[0]
            for i in range(1, n):
                cur = max(cur + nums[i], nums[i])
                res = max(cur, res)
            return res

### Problem Statement
**link:**
https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-subarray/
https://leetcode.cn/problems/maximum-subarray/

Given an integer array nums, find the subarray with the largest sum, and return its sum.

**Example:**

**Input:** `nums = [-2,1,-3,4,-1,2,1,-5,4]`
**Output:** `6`

**Input:** `nums = [1]`
**Output:** `1`

**Input:** `nums = [5,4,-1,7,8]`
**Output:** `23`


### Solution Approach
The solution utilizes Kadane's algorithm to efficiently determine the maximum sum of a contiguous subarray.
 

#### Algorithm

1. Initialization: Begin with the first element as both the current sum (cur) and the maximum sum (res).
2. Iterative Update: For each element, adjust the cur by deciding whether to include the element in the existing subarray or start a new subarray from the current element.
3. Result Determination: Continuously compare and update the res with cur to keep track of the maximum subarray sum, and return res after processing all elements.
