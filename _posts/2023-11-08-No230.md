### Problem Statement
**link:**

https://leetcode.cn/problems/kth-smallest-element-in-a-bst/
 
Given the root of a binary search tree, and an integer k, return the kth smallest value (1-indexed) of all the values of the nodes in the tree.

Follow up: If the BST is modified often (i.e., we can do insert and delete operations) and you need to find the kth smallest frequently, how would you optimize?

**Example:**

**Input:** `root = [3,1,4,null,2], k = 1`
**Output:** `1`
 
**Input:** `root = [5,3,6,2,4,null,null,1], k = 3`
**Output:** `3`
 
### Solution Approach
The problem can be solved by performing an in-order traversal of the binary search tree (BST) and keeping track of the kth smallest element encountered.

#### Algorithm
Approach 1 - Recursive In-Order Traversal
1. Recursively traverse the left subtree of the current node.
2. Check and decrement the k value.
3. If k becomes 0, return the current node's value as the kth smallest element. Otherwise, continue to the right subtree.
Approach 2 - Iterative In-Order Traversal using a Stack
1. Use a stack to iteratively traverse the left subtree of the current node.
2. Pop nodes from the stack, decrement k, and check if k becomes 0.
3. If k is 0, return the value of the popped node as the kth smallest element. Otherwise, move to the right subtree and continue the traversal.
