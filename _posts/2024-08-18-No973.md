### Problem Statement
**link:**
[LeetCode.cn](https://leetcode.cn/problems/k-closest-points-to-origin/)
[LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/k-closest-points-to-origin/)
Given an array of points where points[i] = [xi, yi] represents a point on the X-Y plane and an integer k, return the k closest points to the origin (0, 0).

The distance between two points on the X-Y plane is the Euclidean distance (i.e., âˆš(x1 - x2)2 + (y1 - y2)2).

You may return the answer in any order. The answer is guaranteed to be unique (except for the order that it is in).

**Example:**

**Input:** `points = [[1,3],[-2,2]], k = 1`
**Output:** `[[-2,2]]`

**Input:** `points = [[3,3],[5,-1],[-2,4]], k = 2`
**Output:** `[[3,3],[-2,4]]`

**Constraints:**
1 <= k <= points.length <= 104
-104 <= xi, yi <= 104

### Solution Approach
The solution uses a max-heap to efficiently keep track of the k closest points by comparing the squared Euclidean distance of each point to the origin.

#### Algorithm
1. Calculate Squared Distances: For each point, calculate the squared Euclidean distance to avoid the computational cost of square roots.
2. Maintain a Max-Heap: Use a max-heap to store the k closest points by pushing the negative squared distance into the heap. If the heap size exceeds k, remove the farthest point.
3. Return the Result: After processing all points, extract the points from the heap, which now contains the k closest points to the origin.
