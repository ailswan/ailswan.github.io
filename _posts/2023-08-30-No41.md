### Problem Statement
**link:**

https://leetcode.cn/problems/first-missing-positive/

Given an unsorted integer array nums, return the smallest missing positive integer.

You must implement an algorithm that runs in O(n) time and uses O(1) auxiliary space.

**Example:**

**Input:** `[1,2,0]`
**Output:** `3`

**Input:** `[3,4,-1,1]`
**Output:** `2`

**Input:** `[7,8,9,11,12]`
**Output:** `1`

### Solution Approach

 The solution leverages the fact that the smallest missing positive integer will be in the range 1, n + 1, where n is the size of the array.


#### Algorithm

1. Pre-processing: First, replace all non-positive values and numbers greater than n with a dummy value (n+1).
2. Place-Marking: For each number i in the modified list, if it is between 1 to n, we mark its presence by setting the value at index i-1 as negative. This effectively maps the value with its respective index.
3. Search for Missing Value: Traverse the modified list, and the first index with a positive value will indicate the first missing positive integer, which is index + 1.

This approach ensures an O(n) runtime and utilizes the given space effectively without the need for extra space.
