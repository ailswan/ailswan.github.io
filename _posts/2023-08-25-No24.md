class ListNode:

### Problem Statement
**link:**
https://leetcode.com/problems/swap-nodes-in-pairs/
https://leetcode.cn/problems/swap-nodes-in-pairs/

Given a linked list, swap every two adjacent nodes and return its head. You must solve the problem without modifying the values in the list's nodes (i.e., only nodes themselves may be changed.)

**Example:**

**Input:** `1->2->3->4`

**Output:** `2->1->4->3`

### Solution Approach

Dummy node switch with first node and second node.

#### Algorithm

1. Create a dummy node and attach the head of the linked list to it.
2. Traverse the list and swap pairs of nodes.
3. Attach the swapped nodes to the previous node.
