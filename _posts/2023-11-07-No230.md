### Problem Statement
**link:**
https://leetcode.com/problems/kth-smallest-element-in-a-bst/
https://leetcode.cn/problems/kth-smallest-element-in-a-bst/
 
Given the root of a binary search tree, and an integer k, return the kth smallest value (1-indexed) of all the values of the nodes in the tree.

Follow up: If the BST is modified often (i.e., we can do insert and delete operations) and you need to find the kth smallest frequently, how would you optimize?

**Example:**

**Input:** `root = [3,1,4,null,2], k = 1`
**Output:** `1`
 
**Input:** `root = [5,3,6,2,4,null,null,1], k = 3`
**Output:** `3`
