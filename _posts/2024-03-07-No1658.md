### Problem Statement
**link:**

[LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-operations-to-reduce-x-to-zero/)

You are given an integer array nums and an integer x. In one operation, you can either remove the leftmost or the rightmost element from the array nums and subtract its value from x. Note that this modifies the array for future operations.

Return the minimum number of operations to reduce x to exactly 0 if it is possible, otherwise, return -1.


 
**Example:**

**Input:** `str1 = "nums = [1,1,4,2,3], x = 5", str2 = "2"`
**Output:** `2`
 
**Input:** `nums = [5,6,7,8,9], x = 4`
**Output:** `-1`

**Input:** `nums = [3,2,20,1,1,3], x = 10`
**Output:** `5`

### Solution Approach
The algorithm utilizes a sliding window technique to find the minimum number of operations to reduce 'x' to zero by considering all possible contiguous subarrays.

#### Algorithm
1. Initialization and Validation:
Initialize variables and check if it's possible to achieve 'x' from the total sum of the array.
2. Sliding Window Approach:
Utilize a sliding window technique to find contiguous subarrays with a sum equal to 'x'.
3. Return Minimum Operations:
Return the minimum number of operations if a valid subarray is found; otherwise, return -1.
