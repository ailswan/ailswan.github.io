### Problem Statement

[LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/find-all-anagrams-in-a-string/)

Given two strings s and p, return an array of all the start indices of p's anagrams in s. You may return the answer in any order.

An Anagram is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of a different word or phrase, typically using all the original letters exactly once.

**Example:**

**Input:** `s = "cbaebabacd", p = "abc"`
**Output:** `[0,6]`
 
**Input:** `s = "abab", p = "ab"`
**Output:** `[0,1,2]`
 
### Solution Approach
The key idea of the solution is to utilize a sliding window approach while maintaining character frequency counts to efficiently find all anagrams of string p within string s.

#### Algorithm
1. Frequency Computation: Calculate character frequencies in p.

2. Sliding Window: Slide a window of size len(p) over s, updating character frequencies dynamically.

3. Comparison: Check if the frequency counts of characters in the window match those of p, indicating an anagram, and record the starting index of the window.
