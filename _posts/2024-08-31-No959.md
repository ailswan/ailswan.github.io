### Problem Statement
**link:**
[LeetCode.cn](https://leetcode.cn/problems/regions-cut-by-slashes/)
[LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/regions-cut-by-slashes/)
An n x n grid is composed of 1 x 1 squares where each 1 x 1 square consists of a '/', '\', or blank space ' '. These characters divide the square into contiguous regions.

Given the grid grid represented as a string array, return the number of regions.

Note that backslash characters are escaped, so a '\' is represented as '\\'.

**Example:**

**Input:** `grid = [" /","/ "]`
**Output:** `2`

**Input:** `grid = [" /","  "]`
**Output:** `1`

**Input:** `grid = ["/\\","\\/"]`
**Output:** `5`

**Constraints:**
n == grid.length == grid[i].length
1 <= n <= 30
grid[i][j] is either '/', '\', or ' '.

### Solution Approach
The solution transforms the grid into a larger matrix where each cell is divided into 9 smaller cells based on the slashes, and then uses DFS to count the number of connected components in the resulting matrix.

#### Algorithm
1. Grid Expansion: The original grid is expanded into a larger matrix (3 times the size in both dimensions) where each cell is divided into 9 smaller cells to accommodate the slashes and their impact on the region boundaries.
2. Slash Representation: The slashes (/ and \) are used to mark boundaries in the expanded matrix, creating barriers between different regions by setting appropriate cells to 1.
3. DFS Traversal: A depth-first search (DFS) is performed on the expanded matrix to identify and count distinct regions by marking all connected cells starting from any unvisited cell.

#### Complexity
 **time complexity**: O((3*n)^2) 
 DFS is performed on the expanded grid. In the worst case, every cell in the 3m x 3n grid could be visited once, leading to a time complexity of O((3m) * (3n)) which simplifies to O(m * n).
 **space complexity**: O((3*n)^2)
 The space required to store the 3m x 3n grid is O((3m) * (3n)) which simplifies to O(m * n).
  In the worst case, the depth of the recursion could be the size of the grid, so the space required for the DFS call stack is also O(m * n).
