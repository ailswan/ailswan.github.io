### Problem Statement
**link:**

[LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-duplicate-letters/)

Given a string s, remove duplicate letters so that every letter appears once and only once. You must make sure your result is 
the smallest in lexicographical order
 among all possible results.
 
**Example:**

**Input:** `s = "bcabc"`
**Output:** `"abc"`
 
**Input:** `s = "cbacdcbc"`
**Output:** `"acdb"`

### Solution Approach
The solution involves utilizing a monotonic stack to greedily select characters while ensuring the resulting string is lexicographically smallest.

#### Algorithm
1. Initialize Stack: We initialize an empty stack to hold the characters of the resulting string.
2. Iterate Through Characters: Iterate through each character in the input string s.
3. Greedy Selection: For each character.
