### Problem Statement
**link:**
[LeetCode.cn](https://leetcode.cn/problems/one-edit-distance/)
[LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/one-edit-distance/)
Given two strings s and t, return true if they are both one edit distance apart, otherwise return false.

A string s is said to be one distance apart from a string t if you can:

Insert exactly one character into s to get t.
Delete exactly one character from s to get t.
Replace exactly one character of s with a different character to get t.

**Example:**

**Input:** `s = "ab", t = "acb"`
**Output:** `true`

**Input:** `s = "", t = ""`
**Output:** `false`

**Constraints:**
0 <= s.length, t.length <= 104
s and t consist of lowercase letters, uppercase letters, and digits.

### Solution Approach
The solution uses a two-pointer approach to compare the strings, handling cases of insertion, deletion, or replacement of one character to determine if they are exactly one edit distance apart.
#### Algorithm
1. Length Check:First, the solution compares the lengths of the strings s and t. If the length difference is more than 1, return False immediately, as they can't be one edit distance apart.
2. Character Comparison:Iterate through the characters of both strings using a loop. If a mismatch is found, check whether replacing the character or deleting/inserting a character can make the strings identical from that point onward.
3. Final Check:After the loop, if no differences are found, the strings are one edit distance apart only if their lengths differ by exactly one character.
