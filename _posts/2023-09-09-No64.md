          for i in range(1, n):
              sums[0][i] = sums[0][i - 1] + grid[0][i]

### Problem Statement
**link:**
https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-path-sum/
https://leetcode.cn/problems/minimum-path-sum/

Given a m x n grid filled with non-negative numbers, find a path from top left to bottom right, which minimizes the sum of all numbers along its path.

Note: You can only move either down or right at any point in time.
**Example:**

**Input:** ` grid = [[1,3,1],[1,5,1],[4,2,1]]`
**Output:** `7`

**Input:** `grid = [[1,2,3],[4,5,6]]`
**Output:** `12`


### Solution Approach
Utilize dynamic programming to compute the minimal path sum for each cell by considering the top and left neighbors.
 
#### Algorithm
1. Initialization: Set the top-left cell's value as the grid's initial value.
2. First Row & Column: Compute values by consecutively adding elements from the grid.
3. DP Calculation: For every subsequent cell, set its value as its current grid value plus the minimum of its top and left neighbor. Return the bottom-right cell's value.
