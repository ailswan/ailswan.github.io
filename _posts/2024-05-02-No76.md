### Problem Statement
**link:**
[LeetCode.cn](https://leetcode.cn/problems/minimum-window-substring/)
[LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/minimum-window-substring/)
Given two strings s and t of lengths m and n respectively, return the minimum window 
substring
 of s such that every character in t (including duplicates) is included in the window. If there is no such substring, return the empty string "".

The testcases will be generated such that the answer is unique.

**Example:**

**Input:** `s = "ADOBECODEBANC", t = "ABC"`
**Output:** `"BANC"`

**Input:** `s = "a", t = "a"`
**Output:** `"a"`

**Input:** `s = "a", t = "aa"`
**Output:** `""`
 
### Solution Approach
Use a sliding window and character count arrays to find the smallest substring in s that contains all characters of t.

#### Algorithm
1. Character Mapping: Utilize two count arrays, one for the characters in the target string t and another for the characters in the current window of the source string s, ensuring that both uppercase and lowercase letters are accurately mapped.
2. Sliding Window: Expand the right pointer r to include characters from s into the window and contract the left pointer l to find the smallest possible window that still contains all characters from t.
3. Window Validation: Implement a helper function to check if the current window meets the requirements by comparing the count arrays, and update the minimum window size and starting position when a valid window is found.
