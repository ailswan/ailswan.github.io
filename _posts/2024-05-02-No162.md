### Problem Statement
**link:**

[LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/find-peak-element/)
A peak element is an element that is strictly greater than its neighbors.

Given a 0-indexed integer array nums, find a peak element, and return its index. If the array contains multiple peaks, return the index to any of the peaks.

You may imagine that nums[-1] = nums[n] = -âˆž. In other words, an element is always considered to be strictly greater than a neighbor that is outside the array.

You must write an algorithm that runs in O(log n) time.

**Example:**

**Input:** `nums = [1,2,3,1]`
**Output:** `2`

**Input:** `nums = [1,2,1,3,5,6,4]`
**Output:** `5`
 
### Solution Approach
Use binary search to repeatedly narrow down the search space by comparing the middle element with its neighbors, ensuring the search space reduces logarithmically.

#### Algorithm
1. **Binary Search Implementation**: Use binary search to find a peak element by comparing the middle element with its neighbors.
2. **Adjust Search Space**: If the middle element is greater than the next element, move the search to the left half; otherwise, move to the right half.
3. **Return the Peak**: Continue this process until the search space is reduced to one element, which will be a peak element, and return its index.
