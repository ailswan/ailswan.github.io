### Problem Statement
**link:**
[LeetCode.cn](https://leetcode.cn/problems/merge-k-sorted-lists/)
[LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/merge-k-sorted-lists/)
You are given an array of k linked-lists lists, each linked-list is sorted in ascending order.

Merge all the linked-lists into one sorted linked-list and return it.

**Example:**

**Input:** `lists = [[1,4,5],[1,3,4],[2,6]]`
**Output:** `[1,1,2,3,4,4,5,6]`

**Input:** `lists = []`
**Output:** `[]`
 
 
### Solution Approach
The solution involves merging k sorted linked lists using a min-heap to efficiently manage the smallest elements at each step.

#### Algorithm
Initialization: Initialize an empty min-heap and iterate through the heads of the k lists, pushing their values along with their index into the heap.

Heap-based Merging: While the heap is not empty, pop the minimum value and its corresponding index from the heap, appending it to the result list, and push the next node from the list at that index into the heap if it exists.

Return Merged List: Finally, return the merged sorted list formed by linking the nodes in ascending order.
