### Problem Statement
**link:**

https://leetcode.cn/problems/rotate-list/description/


Given the head of a linked list, rotate the list to the right by k places.

**Example:**

**Input:** `head = [1,2,3,4,5], k = 2`
**Output:** `[4,5,1,2,3]`

**Input:** `head = [0,1,2], k = 4`
**Output:** `[2,0,1]`


### Solution Approach

The solution connects the tail of the list to the head, forming a circular linked list, and then repositions the head to a new node after k rotations.

#### Algorithm
 
1. Traverse the list to determine its length and make it a circular linked list by connecting the tail to the head.
2. Compute the position of the new head by calculating the remainder of k divided by the list length.
3. Move to the determined position, sever the circular connection, and return the new head.
