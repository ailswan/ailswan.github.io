### Problem Statement
**link:**
https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-tree-level-order-traversal-ii/
https://leetcode.cn/problems/binary-tree-level-order-traversal-ii/

Given the root of a binary tree, return the bottom-up level order traversal of its nodes' values. (i.e., from left to right, level by level from leaf to root).


**Example:**

**Input:** `root = [3,9,20,null,null,15,7]`
**Output:** `[[15,7],[9,20],[3]]`
 
**Input:** `root = [1]`
**Output:** `[[1]]`

**Input:** `root = []`
**Output:** `[]`
 

### Solution Approach
The solution leverages a depth-first search (DFS) to traverse the tree and store the nodes' values in a bottom-up level order.
 
#### Algorithm
1. Utilize a depth-first search to traverse the tree, maintaining the current node's depth level.
2. During traversal, append node values to their respective level in the result list or initialize a new list for unseen levels.
3. By manipulating indices based on depth during traversal, the result list captures the bottom-up level order of the tree.
