### Problem Statement

[LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/dot-product-of-two-sparse-vectors/)
Given two sparse vectors, compute their dot product.

Implement class SparseVector:

SparseVector(nums) Initializes the object with the vector nums
dotProduct(vec) Compute the dot product between the instance of SparseVector and vec
A sparse vector is a vector that has mostly zero values, you should store the sparse vector efficiently and compute the dot product between two SparseVector.

Follow up: What if only one of the vectors is sparse?

**Example:**

**Input:** `nums1 = [1,0,0,2,3], nums2 = [0,3,0,4,0]`
**Output:** `8`

**Input:** `nums1 = [0,1,0,0,0], nums2 = [0,0,0,0,2]`
**Output:** `0`

**Input:** `nums1 = [0,1,0,0,2,0,0], nums2 = [1,0,0,0,3,0,4]`
**Output:** `6`

**Constraints:**
n == nums1.length == nums2.length
1 <= n <= 10^5
0 <= nums1[i], nums2[i] <= 100

### Solution Approach
The SparseVector class efficiently computes the dot product of two sparse vectors by storing only non-zero elements and iterating over the sparse representation, ensuring optimized time and space complexity.

#### Algorithm
1. Initialization with Non-Zero Elements: The SparseVector class initializes by storing only the non-zero elements of the vector in a dictionary (self.nonzeros), mapping indices to their values.
2. Efficient Dot Product Calculation: To compute the dot product, the dotProduct method iterates through the non-zero elements of the current vector and checks if the indices exist in the other vector's dictionary, multiplying corresponding values and summing the results.
3. Handling Large Vectors: This approach efficiently handles large vectors with mostly zero values by avoiding operations on zero elements and focusing only on the significant non-zero elements for the dot product calculation.
#### Complexity
 **time complexity**: O(n)
 **space complexity**: O(n)
