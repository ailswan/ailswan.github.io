### Problem Statement
**link:**
[LeetCode.cn](https://leetcode.cn/problems/find-the-index-of-the-first-occurrence-in-a-string/)
[LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/find-the-index-of-the-first-occurrence-in-a-string/)
Given two strings needle and haystack, return the index of the first occurrence of needle in haystack, or -1 if needle is not part of haystack.

**Example:**

**Input:** `haystack = "sadbutsad", needle = "sad"`
**Output:** `0`

**Input:** `haystack = "leetcode", needle = "leeto"`
**Output:** `-1`

**Constraints:**
1 <= haystack.length, needle.length <= 104
haystack and needle consist of only lowercase English characters.

### Solution Approach
Brute Force Approach: Iterate through each possible starting position in the haystack and compare substrings of length equal to needle to find a match.

KMP Algorithm (Solution 1): Utilize the Knuth-Morris-Pratt (KMP) algorithm's partial match table to efficiently find the first occurrence of needle in haystack by skipping redundant comparisons.

KMP Algorithm (Solution 2): Employ an optimized KMP algorithm that uses the partial match table to avoid unnecessary re-evaluations, ensuring linear time complexity for matching needle in haystack.
#### Algorithm
1. Brute Force Approach
Iterate through Start Positions: Start at each index in the haystack and check if a substring of length equal to needle matches needle.

Substring Comparison: For each start position, compare characters of haystack with needle to determine if they are equal.

Return Index or -1: If a match is found, return the starting index of the substring; otherwise, continue searching or return -1 if no match is found.

2. KMP Algorithm (Solution 1)
Compute Partial Match Table: Preprocess the needle to create a table (next array) that holds the length of the longest prefix which is also a suffix for each position in needle.

Pattern Matching with Skips: Use the partial match table to skip over previously matched characters in needle when a mismatch occurs, thereby reducing redundant comparisons.

Return Index or -1: Traverse haystack while using the partial match table to efficiently find and return the starting index of needle or -1 if needle is not found.

3. KMP Algorithm (Solution 2)
Compute Partial Match Table: Create the next array for needle, which helps track the longest proper prefix that is also a suffix for efficient pattern matching.

Simultaneous Traversal: Traverse both haystack and needle simultaneously, using the next array to skip characters in needle when mismatches occur and avoid unnecessary comparisons.

Return Index or -1: Determine if a full match is found by comparing the lengths of haystack and needle, returning the starting index of the first occurrence or -1 if no match is found.
