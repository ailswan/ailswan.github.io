### Problem Statement
**link:**
[LeetCode.cn](https://leetcode.cn/problems/custom-sort-string/)
[LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/custom-sort-string/)
You are given two strings order and s. All the characters of order are unique and were sorted in some custom order previously.

Permute the characters of s so that they match the order that order was sorted. More specifically, if a character x occurs before a character y in order, then x should occur before y in the permuted string.

Return any permutation of s that satisfies this property.

 

**Example:**

**Input:** `order = "cba", s = "abcd"`
**Output:** `"cbad"`

**Input:** `order = "bcafg", s = "abcd"`
**Output:** `"bcad"`

**Constraints:**
1 <= order.length <= 26
1 <= s.length <= 200
order and s consist of lowercase English letters.
All the characters of order are unique.
