[LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/house-robber-iii/)

The thief has found himself a new place for his thievery again. There is only one entrance to this area, called root.

Besides the root, each house has one and only one parent house. After a tour, the smart thief realized that all houses in this place form a binary tree. It will automatically contact the police if two directly-linked houses were broken into on the same night.

Given the root of the binary tree, return the maximum amount of money the thief can rob without alerting the police.
 
**Example:**

**Input:** `root = [3,2,3,null,3,null,1]`
**Output:** `7`
 
**Input:** `root = [3,4,5,1,3,null,1]`
**Output:** `9`
