### Problem Statement
**link:**
https://leetcode.com/problems/unique-binary-search-trees/
https://leetcode.cn/problems/unique-binary-search-trees/


Given an integer n, return the number of structurally unique BST's (binary search trees) which has exactly n nodes of unique values from 1 to n.

**Example:**

**Input:** `n = 3`
**Output:** `5`
 
**Input:** `n = 1`
**Output:** `1`

### Solution Approach
The solution employs a dynamic programming technique to iteratively compute the number of unique BSTs for each value up to 
n by leveraging the Cartesian product of left and right subtree possibilities.
 
#### Algorithm
1. A dynamic programming array dp of size n + 1 is initialized with all values set to 1.
2. For each number i from 2 to n, the algorithm computes the number of unique BSTs by iterating over numbers j from 0 to i-1 and using the formula dp[j] * dp[i-1-j].
3. The final result is the value of dp[n], representing the total unique BSTs for n distinct values.
