### Problem Statement
**link:**

[LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/meeting-rooms-ii/)
Given an array of meeting time intervals intervals where intervals[i] = [starti, endi], return the minimum number of conference rooms required.

**Example:**

**Input:** `intervals = [[0,30],[5,10],[15,20]]`
**Output:** ` 2`

**Input:** `intervals = [[7,10],[2,4]]`
**Output:** `1`

**Constraints:**
1 <= intervals.length <= 104
0 <= starti < endi <= 106
 
### Solution Approach
The solution involves sorting the meeting intervals by start time and using a min-heap to track the end times of ongoing meetings, determining the minimum number of conference rooms needed by keeping track of the maximum number of overlapping meetings at any given time.

#### Algorithm
1. Sort Intervals: Begin by sorting the list of meeting intervals based on their start times to process meetings in chronological order.
2. Use a Min-Heap: Maintain a min-heap to keep track of the end times of the ongoing meetings, efficiently retrieving the earliest end time for comparison.
3. Process Intervals: For each meeting, check if the start time is greater than or equal to the earliest end time in the heap; if so, replace the earliest end time with the new meeting's end time. Otherwise, add the new meeting's end time to the heap, updating the number of required rooms.
