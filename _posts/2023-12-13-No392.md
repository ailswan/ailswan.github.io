### Problem Statement

[LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/is-subsequence/)

Given two strings s and t, return true if s is a subsequence of t, or false otherwise.

A subsequence of a string is a new string that is formed from the original string by deleting some (can be none) of the characters without disturbing the relative positions of the remaining characters. (i.e., "ace" is a subsequence of "abcde" while "aec" is not).
 
**Example:**

**Input:** `s = "abc", t = "ahbgdc"`
**Output:** `true`
 
**Input:** `s = "axc", t = "ahbgdc"`
**Output:** `false`

### Solution Approach
The solution approach utilizes a two-pointer technique to traverse both strings simultaneously, checking for matching characters in order to determine if s is a subsequence of t.

#### Algorithm
1. Initialize two pointers p1 and p2 to track positions in s and t, respectively.
2. Iterate through both strings simultaneously, advancing pointers based on character matches.
3. If p1 reaches the end of s, return True; otherwise, return False.
