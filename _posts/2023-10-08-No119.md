  Class Solution:
    def getRow(self, rowIndex: int) -> List[int]:
        res = [1]
        for j in range(rowIndex):
            for i in range(j, 0, -1):
                res[i] = res[i - 1] + res[i]
            res.append(1)
        return res

### Problem Statement
**link:**
https://leetcode.com/problems/pascals-triangle-ii/
https://leetcode.cn/problems/pascals-triangle-ii/

Given an integer rowIndex, return the rowIndexth (0-indexed) row of the Pascal's triangle.

In Pascal's triangle, each number is the sum of the two numbers directly above it as shown:
**Example:**

**Input:** `rowIndex = 3`
**Output:** `[1,3,3,1]`
 
**Input:** `rowIndex = 0`
**Output:** `[1]`

**Input:** `rowIndex = 1`
**Output:** `[1,1]`

### Solution Approach
The solution makes use of a dynamic programming approach, by incrementally building the Pascal's triangle row-by-row, without storing all the rows.
 
#### Algorithm
1. Initialize the result list with the first value as [1].
2. Iteratively compute each row's values by adding adjacent values from the previous row, starting from the end towards the beginning of the row.
3. After processing each row, append 1 to signify the end of the current row, and repeat until the desired rowIndex is reached.
