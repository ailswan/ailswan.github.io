### Problem Statement
**link:**
https://leetcode.com/problems/isomorphic-strings/
https://leetcode.cn/problems/isomorphic-strings/
 
There are a total of numCourses courses you have to take, labeled from 0 to numCourses - 1. You are given an array prerequisites where prerequisites[i] = [ai, bi] indicates that you must take course bi first if you want to take course ai.

For example, the pair [0, 1], indicates that to take course 0 you have to first take course 1.
Return the ordering of courses you should take to finish all courses. If there are many valid answers, return any of them. If it is impossible to finish all courses, return an empty array

**Example:**

**Input:** `numCourses = 2, prerequisites = [[1,0]]`
**Output:** `[0,1]`
 
**Input:** `numCourses = 4, prerequisites = [[1,0],[2,0],[3,1],[3,2]]`
**Output:** `[0,2,1,3]`
 
**Input:** `numCourses = 1, prerequisites = []`
**Output:** `[0]`

### Solution Approach
To solve this problem, we use topological sorting to determine the order in which courses should be taken.

#### Algorithm
1. Maintain an array inbound to count prerequisites and a dictionary edge to represent course dependencies.
2. Update inbound and edge based on given prerequisites.
3. Initialize a queue q with courses having no prerequisites.
4. Create an empty list res to store the course order.
5. While q is not empty, pop a course cur, add it to res, update dependencies, and add courses with no prerequisites to q.
6. If the length of res equals numCourses, return res; otherwise, return an empty list if not all courses can be completed.
