https://leetcode.cn/problems/minimum-path-sum/

Given a m x n grid filled with non-negative numbers, find a path from top left to bottom right, which minimizes the sum of all numbers along its path.

Note: You can only move either down or right at any point in time.
**Example:**

**Input:** `intervals = [[1,3],[6,9]]`
**Output:** `newInterval = [2,5]`

**Input:** `intervals = [[1,2],[3,5],[6,7],[8,10],[12,16]]`
**Output:** `newInterval = [4,8]`
