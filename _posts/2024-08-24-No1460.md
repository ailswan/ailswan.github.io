[LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/make-two-arrays-equal-by-reversing-subarrays)
You are given two integer arrays of equal length target and arr. In one step, you can select any non-empty subarray of arr and reverse it. You are allowed to make any number of steps.

Return true if you can make arr equal to target or false otherwise.

**Example:**

**Input:** `target = [1,2,3,4], arr = [2,4,1,3]`
**Output:** `true`

**Input:** `target = [7], arr = [7]`
**Output:** `true`

**Input:** `target = [3,7,9], arr = [3,7,11]`
**Output:** `false`

**Constraints:**
target.length == arr.length
1 <= target.length <= 1000
1 <= target[i] <= 1000
1 <= arr[i] <= 1000
