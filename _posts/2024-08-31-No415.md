### Problem Statement
**link:**
[LeetCode.cn](https://leetcode.cn/problems/add-string/)
[LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/add-string/)
Given two non-negative integers, num1 and num2 represented as string, return the sum of num1 and num2 as a string.

You must solve the problem without using any built-in library for handling large integers (such as BigInteger). You must also not convert the inputs to integers directly.

**Example:**

**Input:** `num1 = "11", num2 = "123"`
**Output:** `134`

**Input:** `num1 = "456", num2 = "77"`
**Output:** `533`

**Input:** `num1 = "0", num2 = "0"`
**Output:** `0`

**Constraints:**
1 <= num1.length, num2.length <= 104
num1 and num2 consist of only digits.
num1 and num2 don't have any leading zeros except for the zero itself.

### Solution Approach
The solution simulates the addition of two numbers digit by digit from right to left, managing carry values and building the result string iteratively.

#### Algorithm
1. Digit-by-Digit Addition: Iterate through the digits of both strings from right to left, adding corresponding digits along with any carry from the previous addition.
2. Carry Management: Calculate the carry by dividing the sum of digits by 10 and update the result string with the remainder of the division.
3. Handle Remaining Carry: After processing all digits, if there's any remaining carry, prepend it to the result string to form the final sum.

#### Complexity
 **time complexity**: O(max(len(num1), len(num2)))
 **space complexity**: O(max(len(num1), len(num2)))
