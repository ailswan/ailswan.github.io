### Problem Statement
**link:**
https://leetcode.com/problems/single-number/
https://leetcode.cn/problems/single-number/
 
Given a non-empty array of integers nums, every element appears twice except for one. Find that single one.

You must implement a solution with a linear runtime complexity and use only constant extra space.
 

**Example:**

**Input:** `nums = [2,2,1]`
**Output:** `1`
 
**Input:** `nums = [4,1,2,1,2]`
**Output:** `4`

**Input:** `nums = [1]`
**Output:** `1`
 

### Solution Approach
Use bit manipulation or mathematical properties to isolate the single number from pairs in the array.

#### Algorithm
1. Bit Manipulation (Using XOR): XOR all numbers; identical numbers cancel each other, leaving the single number as the result.
2. Mathematical Approach: Double the sum of unique numbers, then subtract the sum of the entire array to find the single number.
3. The provided code showcases both the XOR and mathematical methods.
