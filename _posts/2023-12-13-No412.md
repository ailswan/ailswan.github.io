[LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/fizz-buzz/)

Given an integer n, return a string array answer (1-indexed) where:

answer[i] == "FizzBuzz" if i is divisible by 3 and 5.
answer[i] == "Fizz" if i is divisible by 3.
answer[i] == "Buzz" if i is divisible by 5.
answer[i] == i (as a string) if none of the above conditions are true.

 
**Example:**

**Input:** `n = 3`
**Output:** `["1","2","Fizz"]`
 
**Input:** `n = 5`
**Output:** `["1","2","Fizz","4","Buzz"]`

**Input:** `n = 15`
**Output:** `["1","2","Fizz","4","Buzz","Fizz","7","8","Fizz","Buzz","11","Fizz","13","14","FizzBuzz"]`
