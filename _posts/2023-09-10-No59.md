### Problem Statement

https://leetcode.cn/problems/spiral-matrix-ii/description/

Given a positive integer n, generate an n x n matrix filled with elements from 1 to n2 in spiral order.

**Example:**

**Input:** `intervals = [[1,3],[6,9]], newInterval = [2,5]`
**Output:** `[[1,5],[6,9]]`

**Input:** `intervals = [[1,2],[3,5],[6,7],[8,10],[12,16]], newInterval = [4,8]`
**Output:** `[[1,2],[3,10],[12,16]]`

### Solution Approach
 
The approach simulates the spiral movement by iteratively filling the matrix while changing direction when hitting boundaries or already-filled cells.

#### Algorithm
- **Matrix Initialization**: Create an `n x n` matrix initialized with zeroes and set up directions for right, down, left, and up movement.
- **Spiral Filling**: Starting from the top-left corner, follow the directions to fill the matrix in a spiral manner with numbers from 1 to \(n^2\).
- **Direction Change**: Whenever a boundary or an already-filled cell is encountered, change the direction clockwise and continue filling until the entire matrix is populated.
