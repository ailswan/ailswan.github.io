### Problem Statement
**link:**

https://leetcode.cn/problems/powx-n/

Implement pow(x, n), which calculates x raised to the power n (i.e., xn).

**Example:**

**Input:** `x = 2.00000, n = 10`
**Output:** `1024.00000`

**Input:** `x = 2.10000, n = 3`
**Output:** `9.26100`

**Input:** `x = 2.00000, n = -2`
**Output:** `0.25000`


### Solution Approach

The solution leverages the properties of exponentiation and iteratively reduces the power to be computed by half, making use of the binary representation of the exponent.

#### Algorithm

1. Inversion for Negative Powers: If the power n is negative, invert the base x (i.e., calculate 1/x) and negate n to make it positive.
2. Iterative Power Reduction: While n is greater than 0, check if n is odd (i.e., n%2 is non-zero). If it is, multiply the result by x. Then, continuously reduce n by half (i.e., floor division by 2) and square x at each step.
3. Final Result: Return the accumulated result, which now represents x raised to the power n.
