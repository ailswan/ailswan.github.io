### Problem Statement
**link:**
https://leetcode.com/problems/word-ladder/
https://leetcode.cn/problems/word-ladder/

A transformation sequence from word beginWord to word endWord using a dictionary wordList is a sequence of words beginWord -> s1 -> s2 -> ... -> sk such that:

Every adjacent pair of words differs by a single letter.
Every si for 1 <= i <= k is in wordList. Note that beginWord does not need to be in wordList.
sk == endWord
Given two words, beginWord and endWord, and a dictionary wordList, return the number of words in the shortest transformation sequence from beginWord to endWord, or 0 if no such sequence exists.

 
**Example:**

**Input:** `beginWord = "hit", endWord = "cog", wordList = ["hot","dot","dog","lot","log","cog"]`
**Output:** `5`
 
**Input:** `beginWord = "hit", endWord = "cog", wordList = ["hot","dot","dog","lot","log"]`
**Output:** `0`
 

### Solution Approach
The problem can be visualized as searching for the shortest path in a graph where each word is a node connected to other words that can be formed by changing a single letter.
 
#### Algorithm
1. Preprocess the Words: Construct a dictionary where the key is a generic word with a wildcard character (like '_') and the value is a list of words from the wordList which match the key pattern. This will help in identifying adjacent nodes (words) in the graph.
2. Bidirectional BFS: Initiate a BFS from both the beginWord and endWord. If the BFS from either direction encounters a word seen by the opposite BFS, a valid sequence is found.
3. Optimization: During each BFS iteration, always expand the frontier from the side with fewer nodes. This makes the algorithm more efficient by exploring less in the BFS.
