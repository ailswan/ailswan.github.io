          def check(node):
              if not node:
                  return 0

              else:
                  return max(left, right) + 1
          return check(root) != -1

### Problem Statement
**link:**
https://leetcode.com/problems/balanced-binary-tree/
https://leetcode.cn/problems/balanced-binary-tree/

Given a binary tree, determine if it is height-balanced


**Example:**

**Input:** `root = [3,9,20,null,null,15,7]`
**Output:** `true`
 
**Input:** `root = [1,2,2,3,3,null,null,4,4]`
**Output:** `false`

**Input:** `root = []`
**Output:** `true`
 

### Solution Approach
The solution uses a depth-first search (DFS) to assess each subtree's balance, terminating early if any part is found unbalanced.
 
#### Algorithm
1. DFS Recursive Function: The check function returns the depth if a subtree is balanced, and -1 otherwise.
2. Depth Evaluation: For each node, the function evaluates the balance of its left and right subtrees, and if either is unbalanced, the -1 value is propagated upwards.
3. Balanced Tree Check: The isBalanced function determines tree balance by seeing if the root's evaluation through check equals -1.
