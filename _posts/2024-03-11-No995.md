### Problem Statement
**link:**
[LeetCode.cn](https://leetcode.cn/problems/minimum-number-of-k-consecutive-bit-flips/)
[LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/minimum-number-of-k-consecutive-bit-flips/)

You are given a binary array nums and an integer k.

A k-bit flip is choosing a subarray of length k from nums and simultaneously changing every 0 in the subarray to 1, and every 1 in the subarray to 0.

Return the minimum number of k-bit flips required so that there is no 0 in the array. If it is not possible, return -1.

A subarray is a contiguous part of an array.

**Example:**

**Input:** `nums = [0,1,0], k = 1`
**Output:** `2`
 
**Input:** `nums = [1,1,0], k = 2`
**Output:** `-1`

**Input:** `nums = [0,0,0,1,0,1,1,0], k = 3`
**Output:** `3`
 
### Solution Approach
The algorithm maintains a sliding window using a deque to keep track of the indices of the bits to flip. It iterates through the array, flipping bits as necessary, and returns the count of flips required or -1 if it's not possible.

#### Algorithm
1. Maintain Sliding Window:
Use a deque q to track indices for bits to flip.
Remove indices outside the current window.
2. Check and Flip Bits:
If the deque size modulo 2 matches the current bit, flip bits and count.
Return -1 if flipping extends beyond array bounds.
3. Return Result:
Return the count of flips required.
