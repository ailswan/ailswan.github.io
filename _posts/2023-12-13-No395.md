### Problem Statement
**link:**
[LeetCode.cn](https://leetcode.cn/problems/longest-substring-with-at-least-k-repeating-characters/)
[LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-substring-with-at-least-k-repeating-characters/)

Given a string s and an integer k, return the length of the longest substring of s such that the frequency of each character in this substring is greater than or equal to k.

if no such substring exists, return 0.
 
**Example:**

**Input:** `s = "aaabb", k = 3`
**Output:** `3`
 
**Input:** `s = "ababbc", k = 2`
**Output:** `5`

### Solution Approach
The solution utilizes a divide and conquer approach to find the longest substring with at least k repeating characters. 

#### Algorithm
1. If the length of the input string s is less than k, return 0 as no valid substring can be formed.
2. Iterate through each unique character c in the set of s.
3. If the count of character c in the string is less than k, split the string at character c and recursively find the longest substring for each split substring.
4. Return the maximum length of the substrings obtained from the recursive calls.
