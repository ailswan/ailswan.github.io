### Problem Statement
**link:**
https://leetcode.com/problems/edit-distance/
https://leetcode.cn/problems/edit-distance/

Given two strings word1 and word2, return the minimum number of operations required to convert word1 to word2.

You have the following three operations permitted on a word:

Insert a character
Delete a character
Replace a character


**Example:**

**Input:** `word1 = "horse", word2 = "ros"`
**Output:** `3`

**Input:** `word1 = "intention", word2 = "execution"`
**Output:** `5`


### Solution Approach
The problem is solved using dynamic programming where each entry in a 2D table represents the minimum number of edits needed to convert a prefix of word1 to a prefix of word2.
 
#### Algorithm
 
1. Initialization: Create a 2D table dp where dp[i][j] indicates edits to convert the first i characters of word1 to j characters of word2.
2. Population: If characters match, dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j-1]. If not, factor in the cost of insertions, deletions, or replacements.
3. Result: The value dp[len(word1)][len(word2)] gives the minimum operations to convert word1 to word2.
