### Problem Statement
**link:**
https://leetcode.com/problems/scramble-string/
https://leetcode.cn/problems/scramble-string/


We can scramble a string s to get a string t using the following algorithm:

If the length of the string is 1, stop.
If the length of the string is > 1, do the following:
Split the string into two non-empty substrings at a random index, i.e., if the string is s, divide it to x and y where s = x + y.
Randomly decide to swap the two substrings or to keep them in the same order. i.e., after this step, s may become s = x + y or s = y + x.
Apply step 1 recursively on each of the two substrings x and y.
Given two strings s1 and s2 of the same length, return true if s2 is a scrambled string of s1, otherwise, return false.

**Example:**

**Input:** `s1 = "great", s2 = "rgeat"`
**Output:** `true`

**Input:** `s1 = "abcde", s2 = "caebd"`
**Output:** `false`

**Input:** `s1 = "a", s2 = "a"`
**Output:** `true`
 

### Solution Approach
The problem is tackled using a recursive divide-and-conquer method, enhanced with dynamic programming to cache results and avoid repetitive calculations.
 
#### Algorithm
 
1. Initial Verification: Compare the sorted characters of s1 and s2 for a quick mismatch identification.
2. Recursive Substring Evaluation: For every possible split of the strings, examine both the original and swapped substring combinations, determining if they can be scrambled forms of each other.
3. Memoization: Utilize a dynamic programming dictionary to store and retrieve previously calculated results for substring pairs, optimizing the performance.
