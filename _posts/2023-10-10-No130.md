### Problem Statement
**link:**
https://leetcode.com/problems/surrounded-regions/
https://leetcode.cn/problems/surrounded-regions/

Given an m x n matrix board containing 'X' and 'O', capture all regions that are 4-directionally surrounded by 'X'.

A region is captured by flipping all 'O's into 'X's in that surrounded region.

**Example:**

**Input:** `board = [["X","X","X","X"],["X","O","O","X"],["X","X","O","X"],["X","O","X","X"]]`
**Output:** `[["X","X","X","X"],["X","X","X","X"],["X","X","X","X"],["X","O","X","X"]]`
 
**Input:** `board = [["X"]]`
**Output:** `[["X"]]`
 

### Solution Approach
The solution uses depth-first search (DFS) to traverse the board's perimeter, marking safe regions that aren't surrounded, and then updates the board accordingly.
 
#### Algorithm
1. Perimeter Check: Start by checking the board's edges for 'O' characters and use DFS to mark all the 'O's connected to them with a placeholder (e.g., '#') as these are safe regions that aren't entirely surrounded by 'X'.
2. Update Board: After marking, traverse the entire board and change all remaining 'O's to 'X' as they represent surrounded regions.
3. Revert Placeholder: Convert back all the placeholder '#' characters to 'O' since these were identified as safe in the first step.
