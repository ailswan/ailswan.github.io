### Problem Statement
**link:**

[LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/combination-sum-iv/)

Given an array of distinct integers nums and a target integer target, return the number of possible combinations that add up to target.

The test cases are generated so that the answer can fit in a 32-bit integer.
 
**Example:**

**Input:** `nums = [1,2,3], target = 4`
**Output:** `7`
 
**Input:** `nums = [9], target = 3`
**Output:** `0`

### Solution Approach
This solution utilizes dynamic programming to efficiently compute the number of combinations that sum up to the target integer.

#### Algorithm
1. Initialize a dynamic programming array dp to track the number of combinations that sum up to each value from 0 to the target.
2. Populate dp[0] with 1, indicating there's one way to make a sum of 0 (by choosing no elements).
3. Iterate over integers from 1 to the target, updating dp[i] by summing up the number of combinations for i - n, where n is each number in the input array nums.
