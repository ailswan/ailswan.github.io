### Problem Statement

[LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/add-to-array-form-of-integer/)
 
The array-form of an integer num is an array representing its digits in left to right order.

For example, for num = 1321, the array form is [1,3,2,1].
Given num, the array-form of an integer, and an integer k, return the array-form of the integer num + k.


**Example:**

**Input:** `num = [1,2,0,0], k = 34`
**Output:** `[1,2,3,4]`
 
**Input:** `num = [2,7,4], k = 181`
**Output:** `[4,5,5]`
 
**Input:** `num = [2,1,5], k = 806`
**Output:** `[1,0,2,1]`

### Solution Approach
The algorithm adds the integer k to the array-form of num by processing digits from the end and handling carry-over in-place, ensuring a time complexity of O(N) and space complexity of O(N).

#### Algorithm
1. In-place Modification: The algorithm modifies the array num in-place by iterating from the end to the beginning, handling carry-over directly within the array.
2. Carry Handling: If there is a carry left after processing all digits, it is converted to a string, mapped to a list of its digits, and prepended to the result, ensuring proper digit placement.
3. Efficient Handling: This method processes each digit at most twice (once for addition and once for carry propagation), achieving a time complexity of O(N) and a space complexity of O(N), where N is the length of the resulting array.

#### Complexity
 **time complexity**: O(n)
 **space complexity**: O(n)
