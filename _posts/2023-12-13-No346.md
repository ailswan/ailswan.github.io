### Problem Statement

[LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/moving-average-from-data-stream/)

Given a stream of integers and a window size, calculate the moving average of all integers in the sliding window.

Implement the MovingAverage class:

MovingAverage(int size) Initializes the object with the size of the window size.
double next(int val) Returns the moving average of the last size values of the stream.

 
**Example:**

**Input:** `["MovingAverage", "next", "next", "next", "next"][[3], [1], [10], [3], [5]]`
**Output:** `[null, 1.0, 5.5, 4.66667, 6.0]`
