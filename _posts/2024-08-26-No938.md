### Problem Statement
**link:**
https://leetcode.com/problems/range-sum-of-bst/
https://leetcode.cn/problems/range-sum-of-bst/
 
Given the root node of a binary search tree and two integers low and high, return the sum of values of all nodes with a value in the inclusive range [low, high].

**Example:**

**Input:** `root = [10,5,15,3,7,null,18], low = 7, high = 15`
**Output:** `32`
 
**Input:** `root = [10,5,15,3,7,13,18,1,null,6], low = 6, high = 10`
**Output:** `23`

Constraints:

The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [1, 2 * 10^4].
1 <= Node.val <= 10^5
1 <= low <= high <= 10^5
All Node.val are unique.
 
### Solution Approach
The algorithm traverses the binary search tree (BST) using either depth-first search (DFS) or breadth-first search (BFS) to accumulate the sum of node values that fall within the given range [low, high], efficiently skipping branches that do not contribute to the result.

#### Algorithm
1. Range Filtering: The algorithm efficiently skips subtrees that are outside the given range [low, high], avoiding unnecessary computation by checking node values before traversing their children.
2. Traversal Methods: Both depth-first search (DFS) and breadth-first search (BFS) approaches are utilized to visit nodes within the specified range, accumulating the sum of valid node values.
3. Early Stopping: The algorithm leverages BST properties, such as left and right subtrees' value constraints, to stop traversing paths that cannot contain values within the range, improving performance.

#### Complexity
 **time complexity**: O(n)
 **space complexity**: O(h)
