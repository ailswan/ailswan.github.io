### Problem Statement
**link:**
[LeetCode.cn](https://leetcode.cn/problems/random-pick-index/)
[LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/random-pick-index/)
Given an integer array nums with possible duplicates, randomly output the index of a given target number. You can assume that the given target number must exist in the array.

Implement the Solution class:

Solution(int[] nums) Initializes the object with the array nums.
int pick(int target) Picks a random index i from nums where nums[i] == target. If there are multiple valid i's, then each index should have an equal probability of returning.
 

**Example:**

**Input:** `["Solution", "pick", "pick", "pick"][[[1, 2, 3, 3, 3]], [3], [1], [3]]`
**Output:** `[null, 4, 0, 2]`
 

**Constraints:**
1 <= nums.length <= 2 * 104
-231 <= nums[i] <= 231 - 1
target is an integer from nums.
At most 104 calls will be made to pick.
 
### Solution Approach
Store the indices of each number in a dictionary, and then randomly select an index from the list of indices corresponding to the target number.
#### Algorithm
1. Store Indices: Use a dictionary to map each number in the array to a list of its indices.
2. Random Selection: When picking, retrieve the list of indices for the target number.
3. Return Random Index: Randomly select and return an index from the list using a random choice function.
