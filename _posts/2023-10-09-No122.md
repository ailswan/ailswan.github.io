### Problem Statement
**link:**
https://leetcode.com/problems/best-time-to-buy-and-sell-stock-ii/
https://leetcode.cn/problems/best-time-to-buy-and-sell-stock-ii/

You are given an integer array prices where prices[i] is the price of a given stock on the ith day.

On each day, you may decide to buy and/or sell the stock. You can only hold at most one share of the stock at any time. However, you can buy it then immediately sell it on the same day.

Find and return the maximum profit you can achieve.


**Example:**

**Input:** `prices = [7,1,5,3,6,4]`
**Output:** `7`
 
**Input:** `prices = [1,2,3,4,5]`
**Output:** `4`

**Input:** `prices = [7,6,4,3,1]`
**Output:** `0`
 

### Solution Approach
The problem can be efficiently solved by exploiting the nature of peaks and valleys in the given stock prices using a greedy algorithm.
 
#### Algorithm
 
1. Iterate through the given prices array.
2. For every index, check if the current price is higher than the previous day's price.
3. If it's higher, add the difference to the total profit. This approach essentially captures the profit from every upward transaction possible.
