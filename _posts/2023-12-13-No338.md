  class Solution:
      def countBits(self, n: int) -> List[int]:
        res = [0] * (n + 1)
        for i in range(n + 1):
            res[i] = res[i >> 1] + (i & 1)
        return res

[LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/counting-bits/)

Given an integer n, return an array ans of length n + 1 such that for each i (0 <= i <= n), ans[i] is the number of 1's in the binary representation of i.
 
**Example:**

**Input:** `n = 2`
**Output:** `[0,1,1]`
 
**Input:** `n = 5`
**Output:** `[0,1,1,2,1,2]`
