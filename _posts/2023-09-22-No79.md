### Problem Statement
**link:**
https://leetcode.com/problems/word-search/
https://leetcode.cn/problems/word-search/


Given an m x n grid of characters board and a string word, return true if word exists in the grid.

The word can be constructed from letters of sequentially adjacent cells, where adjacent cells are horizontally or vertically neighboring. The same letter cell may not be used more than once.

**Example:**

**Input:** `board = [["A","B","C","E"],["S","F","C","S"],["A","D","E","E"]],word = "ABCCED"`
**Output:** `true`

**Input:** `board = [["A","B","C","E"],["S","F","C","S"],["A","D","E","E"]],word = "SEE"`
**Output:** `true`
 
**Input:** `board = [["A","B","C","E"],["S","F","C","S"],["A","D","E","E"]],word = "ABCB"`
**Output:** `false`
 
### Solution Approach
Utilizing Depth-First Search (DFS), navigate the grid to find a path that sequentially constructs the given word, backtracking when necessary.
 
#### Algorithm
1. Start: Identify cells that match the first letter of the word.
2. DFS: From each starting cell, explore neighboring cells using DFS, ensuring each matches the next letter and isn't revisited.
3. Backtrack: If no match is found, backtrack to explore alternate paths.
