[LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/valid-perfect-square/)

Given a positive integer num, return true if num is a perfect square or false otherwise.

A perfect square is an integer that is the square of an integer. In other words, it is the product of some integer with itself.

You must not use any built-in library function, such as sqrt.
 
**Example:**

**Input:** `num = 16`
**Output:** `true`
 
**Input:** `num = 14`
**Output:** `false`
