### Problem Statement
**link:**
[LeetCode.cn](https://leetcode.cn/problems/merge-strings-alternately/)
[LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/merge-strings-alternately/)
You are given two strings word1 and word2. Merge the strings by adding letters in alternating order, starting with word1. If a string is longer than the other, append the additional letters onto the end of the merged string.

Return the merged string.


**Example:**

**Input:** `word1 = "abc", word2 = "pqr"`
**Output:** `"apbqcr"`

**Input:** `word1 = "ab", word2 = "pqrs"`
**Output:** `"apbqrs"`

**Constraints:**
1 <= word1.length, word2.length <= 100
word1 and word2 consist of lowercase English letters.

### Solution Approach
Merge characters from both strings alternately and append any remaining characters from the longer string to the result.

#### Algorithm
1. Iterate through both strings simultaneously: Use a loop to alternate appending characters from word1 and word2 to the result string until reaching the end of the shorter string.
2. Handle remaining characters: After the loop, concatenate the remaining characters from the longer string to the result string.
3. Return the merged string: Construct and return the final merged string by combining the alternated characters and any leftover characters.

#### Complexity
 **time complexity**: O(n)
 **space complexity**: O(n)
