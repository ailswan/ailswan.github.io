python_code: >
  # buy1[i] = max(buy1[i - 1], -prices[i])
  # sell1[i] = max(sell1[i - 1], buy1[i] + prices[i])
  # buy2[i] = max(buy2[i - 1], sell1[i] - prices[i])
  # sell2[i] = max(sells[i - 1], buy2[i] + prices[i])
  class Solution:
      def maxProfit(self, prices: List[int]) -> int:
          sell1 = sell2 = 0
          buy1 = buy2 = -float('inf')
          for p in prices:
              buy1 = max(buy1, -p)
              sell1 = max(sell1, buy1 + p)
              buy2 = max(buy2, sell1 - p)
              sell2 = max(sell2, buy2 + p)
          return sell2

### Problem Statement
**link:**

https://leetcode.cn/problems/populating-next-right-pointers-in-each-node-ii/

You are given an array prices where prices[i] is the price of a given stock on the ith day.

Find the maximum profit you can achieve. You may complete at most two transactions.

Note: You may not engage in multiple transactions simultaneously (i.e., you must sell the stock before you buy again).

**Example:**

**Input:** `prices = [3,3,5,0,0,3,1,4]`
**Output:** `6`
 
**Input:** `prices = [1,2,3,4,5]`
**Output:** `4`

**Input:** `prices = [7,6,4,3,1]`
**Output:** `0`
 

### Solution Approach
The problem is tackled by utilizing dynamic programming to keep track of the profit after each buy and sell action over two transactions.
 
#### Algorithm
1. Initialization: Set four variables buy1, sell1, buy2, and sell2 to track profits for two transactions.
2. Iteration: For each price, update the buy and sell variables by comparing their previous values with potential profit scenarios.
3. Result: The final profit after two transactions is stored in sell2.
