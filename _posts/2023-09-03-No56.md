### Problem Statement
**link:**
https://leetcode.com/problems/merge-intervals/
https://leetcode.cn/problems/merge-intervals/

Given an array of intervals where intervals[i] = [starti, endi], merge all overlapping intervals, and return an array of the non-overlapping intervals that cover all the intervals in the input.

**Example:**

**Input:** `intervals = [[1,3],[2,6],[8,10],[15,18]]`
**Output:** `[[1,6],[8,10],[15,18]]`

**Input:** `intervals = [[1,4],[4,5]]`
**Output:** `[[1,5]]`

### Solution Approach

The key idea is to first sort the intervals by their starting points and then merge overlapping intervals in a single pass.

#### Algorithm

1. Sort Intervals: Sort by starting points using the lambda function.
2. Initialize: Create an empty new_interval list for merged intervals.
3. Merge Overlaps: Traverse sorted intervals. If no overlap with the last in new_interval, append; if overlap, merge by updating the end point.
