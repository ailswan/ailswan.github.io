### Problem Statement
**link:**
https://leetcode.com/problems/rotate-image/
https://leetcode.cn/problems/rotate-image/

You are given an n x n 2D matrix representing an image, rotate the image by 90 degrees (clockwise).

You have to rotate the image in-place, which means you have to modify the input 2D matrix directly. DO NOT allocate another 2D matrix and do the rotation.

**Example:**

**Input:** `matrix = [[1,2,3],[4,5,6],[7,8,9]]`
**Output:** `[[7,4,1],[8,5,2],[9,6,3]]`

**Input:** `matrix = [[5,1,9,11],[2,4,8,10],[13,3,6,7],[15,14,12,16]]`
**Output:** `[[15,13,2,5],[14,3,4,1],[12,6,8,9],[16,7,10,11]]`


### Solution Approach

The solution employs an in-place approach by first flipping the matrix horizontally and then transposing it (i.e., swapping elements across its primary diagonal).
 
#### Algorithm
1. Horizontal Flip: Swap rows symmetrically from top to bottom.
2. Transpose: Swap elements across the primary diagonal.
3. Ensure iteration ranges are selected to avoid double swaps.
