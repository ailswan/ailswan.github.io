### Problem Statement
**link:**
https://leetcode.com/problems/reorder-list/
https://leetcode.cn/problems/reorder-list/

You are given the head of a singly linked-list. The list can be represented as:

L0 → L1 → … → Ln - 1 → Ln
Reorder the list to be on the following form:

L0 → Ln → L1 → Ln - 1 → L2 → Ln - 2 → …
You may not modify the values in the list's nodes. Only nodes themselves may be changed.
 

**Example:**

**Input:** `root = [1,2,3]`
**Output:** `25`
 
**Input:** `root = [4,9,0,5,1]`
**Output:** `1026`
 

### Solution Approach
To reorder the list as specified, first find the middle of the linked list, reverse the second half, and then merge the two halves together.

#### Algorithm
1. Finding the Middle of the List: Use the slow and fast pointers approach. Move one pointer one step at a time and the other two steps at a time. When the fast pointer reaches the end, the slow pointer will be at the middle.
2. Reverse the Second Half: Starting from the middle (found using the slow pointer), reverse the second half of the linked list.
3. Merge the Two Halves: Start from the head and the beginning of the reversed half, and alternately merge nodes from the first half and the reversed half to achieve the desired reorder.
