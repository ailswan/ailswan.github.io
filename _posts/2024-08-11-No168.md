### Problem Statement

[LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/excel-sheet-column-title/)
Given an integer columnNumber, return its corresponding column title as it appears in an Excel sheet.
For example:

A -> 1
B -> 2
C -> 3
...
Z -> 26
AA -> 27
AB -> 28 
...
**Example:**

**Input:** `columnNumber = 1`
**Output:** `"A"`

**Input:** `columnNumber = 28`
**Output:** `"AB"`

**Input:** `columnNumber = 701`
**Output:** `"ZY"`


**Constraints:**
1 <= columnNumber <= 231 - 1

### Solution Approach
The algorithm iteratively calculates the corresponding character for each digit in the base-26 numeral system by adjusting the column number and appending the appropriate character to the result string, which is then reversed to obtain the final column title.

#### Algorithm
1. Base-26 Conversion: The solution treats the column number as a base-26 numeral system where 'A' corresponds to 1, 'B' to 2, and so on, until 'Z', which corresponds to 26.
2. Offset Calculation: In each iteration, the offset (columnNumber - 1) % 26 is used to determine the correct character by mapping it to the range 'A' to 'Z'.
3. Reverse Construction: The characters are appended in reverse order during the calculation, so the resulting string is reversed at the end to produce the correct column title.
