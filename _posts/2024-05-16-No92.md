### Problem Statement
**link:**

[LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/reverse-linked-list-ii/)
Given the head of a singly linked list and two integers left and right where left <= right, reverse the nodes of the list from position left to position right, and return the reversed list.

**Example:**

**Input:** `head = [1,2,3,4,5], left = 2, right = 4`
**Output:** `[1,4,3,2,5]`

**Input:** `head = [5], left = 1, right = 1`
**Output:** `[5]`
 
### Solution Approach

To reverse a portion of a linked list between positions left and right, iterate through the list until reaching the node before position left. Then, reverse the nodes between left and right using iterative swapping.

#### Algorithm
1. Traverse the list until reaching the node before position left.
2. Reverse the nodes between positions left and right using iterative swapping.
3. Ensure proper handling of pointers to maintain the integrity of the linked list structure.
