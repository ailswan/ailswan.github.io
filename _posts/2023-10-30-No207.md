### Problem Statement
**link:**
https://leetcode.com/problems/course-schedule/
https://leetcode.cn/problems/course-schedule/
 
There are a total of numCourses courses you have to take, labeled from 0 to numCourses - 1. You are given an array prerequisites where prerequisites[i] = [ai, bi] indicates that you must take course bi first if you want to take course ai.

For example, the pair [0, 1], indicates that to take course 0 you have to first take course 1.
Return true if you can finish all courses. Otherwise, return false.

 

**Example:**

**Input:** `numCourses = 2, prerequisites = [[1,0]]`
**Output:** `true`
 
**Input:** `numCourses = 2, prerequisites = [[1,0],[0,1]]`
**Output:** `false`

### Solution Approach
To solve this problem, we use the topological sorting approach based on BFS to identify if a cycle exists in the course dependency graph.

#### Algorithm
1. Graph Initialization: Create an adjacency list for the directed graph from the given prerequisites and also maintain an inbound array that keeps track of the number of prerequisites for each course.
2. Queue Population: Initialize a queue and enqueue all the courses that don't have any prerequisites (inbound count is 0).
3. Topological Sort: While the queue is not empty, dequeue the course, mark it as visited, and reduce the inbound count of all its dependent courses. If the inbound count of any course becomes 0, enqueue it. If all the courses are visited by the end of the loop, it means there is no cycle, and it is possible to finish all courses. Otherwise, it is not possible.
