### Problem Statement
**link:**
https://leetcode.com/problems/jump-game-ii/
https://leetcode.cn/problems/jump-game-ii/

You are given a 0-indexed array of integers nums of length n. You are initially positioned at nums[0].

Each element nums[i] represents the maximum length of a forward jump from index i. In other words, if you are at nums[i], you can jump to any nums[i + j] where:

0 <= j <= nums[i] and
i + j < n
Return the minimum number of jumps to reach nums[n - 1]. The test cases are generated such that you can reach nums[n - 1].

**Example:**

**Input:** `[2,3,1,1,4]`
**Output:** `2`

**Input:** `[2,3,0,1,4]`
**Output:** `2`
