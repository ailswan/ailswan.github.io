### Problem Statement

https://leetcode.cn/problems/path-sum-ii/

Given the root of a binary tree and an integer targetSum, return all root-to-leaf paths where the sum of the node values in the path equals targetSum. Each path should be returned as a list of the node values, not node references.

A root-to-leaf path is a path starting from the root and ending at any leaf node. A leaf is a node with no children.

**Example:**

**Input:** `root = [5,4,8,11,null,13,4,7,2,null,null,5,1], targetSum = 22`
**Output:** `[[5,4,11,2],[5,8,4,5]]`
 
**Input:** `root = [1,2,3], targetSum = 5`
**Output:** `[]`

**Input:** `root = [1,2], targetSum = 0`
**Output:** `[]`
