### Problem Statement
**link:**
https://leetcode.com/problems/plus-one/
https://leetcode.cn/problems/plus-one/


You are given a large integer represented as an integer array digits, where each digits[i] is the ith digit of the integer. The digits are ordered from most significant to least significant in left-to-right order. The large integer does not contain any leading 0's.

Increment the large integer by one and return the resulting array of digits.


**Example:**

**Input:** `digits = [1,2,3]`
**Output:** `[1,2,4]`

**Input:** `digits = [4,3,2,1]`
**Output:** `[4,3,2,2]`

**Input:** `digits = [9]`
**Output:** `[1,0]`


### Solution Approach

Simulate the process of elementary addition starting from the least significant digit.

#### Algorithm
 
1. Iteration: Begin from the last digit, adding one.
2. Carry Management: If it becomes 10, set it to 0 and carry one to the previous digit.
3. Overflow: If all digits are 9, prepend a 1 to handle overflow.
