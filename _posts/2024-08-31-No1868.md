### Problem Statement
**link:**

[LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/product-of-two-run-length-encoded-arrays/)
Run-length encoding is a compression algorithm that allows for an integer array nums with many segments of consecutive repeated numbers to be represented by a (generally smaller) 2D array encoded. Each encoded[i] = [vali, freqi] describes the ith segment of repeated numbers in nums where vali is the value that is repeated freqi times.

For example, nums = [1,1,1,2,2,2,2,2] is represented by the run-length encoded array encoded = [[1,3],[2,5]]. Another way to read this is "three 1's followed by five 2's".
The product of two run-length encoded arrays encoded1 and encoded2 can be calculated using the following steps:

Expand both encoded1 and encoded2 into the full arrays nums1 and nums2 respectively.
Create a new array prodNums of length nums1.length and set prodNums[i] = nums1[i] * nums2[i].
Compress prodNums into a run-length encoded array and return it.
You are given two run-length encoded arrays encoded1 and encoded2 representing full arrays nums1 and nums2 respectively. Both nums1 and nums2 have the same length. Each encoded1[i] = [vali, freqi] describes the ith segment of nums1, and each encoded2[j] = [valj, freqj] describes the jth segment of nums2.

Return the product of encoded1 and encoded2.

Note: Compression should be done such that the run-length encoded array has the minimum possible length.

**Example:**

**Input:** `encoded1 = [[1,3],[2,3]], encoded2 = [[6,3],[3,3]]`
**Output:** `[[6,6]]`

**Input:** `encoded1 = [[1,3],[2,1],[3,2]], encoded2 = [[2,3],[3,3]]`
**Output:** `[[2,3],[6,1],[9,2]]`

**Constraints:**
1 <= encoded1.length, encoded2.length <= 10^5
encoded1[i].length == 2
encoded2[j].length == 2
1 <= vali, freqi <= 10^4 for each encoded1[i].
1 <= valj, freqj <= 10^4 for each encoded2[j].
The full arrays that encoded1 and encoded2 represent are the same length.

### Solution Approach
The solution uses two pointers to iterate through the run-length encoded arrays, multiplying corresponding values and managing frequency counts, while merging results into a compressed run-length encoded format.

#### Algorithm
1. Two-Pointer Technique: The algorithm uses two pointers to traverse the run-length encoded arrays simultaneously, comparing and processing the segments from both arrays.
2. Frequency Management: It manages the remaining frequencies of segments (remain1 and remain2) to handle cases where segment lengths differ, ensuring that all values are processed correctly.
3. Merging and Compression: As it processes segments, the algorithm multiplies values from both arrays and merges the results into a compressed run-length encoded format, combining consecutive segments with the same value to minimize the output size.

#### Complexity
 **time complexity**: O(n1 + n2)
 **space complexity**: O(n)
