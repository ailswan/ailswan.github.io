### Problem Statement
**link:**

https://leetcode.cn/problems/binary-tree-maximum-path-sum/

A path in a binary tree is a sequence of nodes where each pair of adjacent nodes in the sequence has an edge connecting them. A node can only appear in the sequence at most once. Note that the path does not need to pass through the root.

The path sum of a path is the sum of the node's values in the path.

Given the root of a binary tree, return the maximum path sum of any non-empty path.


**Example:**

**Input:** `root = [1,2,3]`
**Output:** `6`
 
**Input:** `root = [-10,9,20,null,null,15,7]`
**Output:** `42`
