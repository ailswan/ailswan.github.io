### Problem Statement
**link:**
[LeetCode.cn](https://leetcode.cn/problems/perfect-squares/)
[LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/perfect-squares/)

Given an integer n, return the least number of perfect square numbers that sum to n.

A perfect square is an integer that is the square of an integer; in other words, it is the product of some integer with itself. For example, 1, 4, 9, and 16 are perfect squares while 3 and 11 are not.

 
**Example:**

**Input:** `n = 12`
**Output:** `3`
 
**Input:** `n = 13`
**Output:** `2`

### Solution Approach
**Dynamic Programming (DP) Solution**
The dynamic programming solution initializes an array to store the minimum number of perfect squares needed for each value and iterates through all possible square numbers to compute the minimum count for the given integer n.
**Breadth-First Search (BFS) Solution**
The breadth-first search solution explores the solution space by subtracting perfect square numbers from the given integer n, incrementing the level of exploration until a perfect square is reached, determining the minimum number of perfect squares required.

#### Algorithm
**Dynamic Programming (DP) Solution:**

Initialize an array dp to store the minimum number of perfect squares needed for each value from 0 to n.
Iterate through each value, considering all possible square numbers up to the square root of n.
Update the minimum count based on the previously computed values, and the final result is the minimum count for n.

**Breadth-First Search (BFS) Solution:**
Start with the given integer n and initialize a level variable to track the exploration depth.
Explore all possible reductions by subtracting perfect square numbers from n, incrementing the level with each iteration.
Continue the search until a perfect square is reached, and the level of exploration at that point is the minimum number of perfect squares required to sum to n.
