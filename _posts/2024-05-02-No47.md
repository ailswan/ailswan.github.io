### Problem Statement

[LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/permutations-ii/)
Given a collection of numbers, nums, that might contain duplicates, return all possible unique permutations in any order.

**Example:**

**Input:** `nums = [1,1,2]`
**Output:** `[[1,1,2],[1,2,1],[2,1,1]]`

**Input:** `nums = [1,2,3]`
**Output:** `[[1,2,3],[1,3,2],[2,1,3],[2,3,1],[3,1,2],[3,2,1]]`
 
### Solution Approach

Sort the input list and use backtracking with a boolean array to track used elements, ensuring that duplicates are skipped to generate all unique permutations.

#### Algorithm
1. Sorting: Start by sorting the input list to ensure duplicates are adjacent, making it easier to skip them during permutation generation.
2. Backtracking with Used Tracking: Use a backtracking function with a boolean array to track which elements are already included in the current permutation path.
3. Skipping Duplicates: During the backtracking process, skip adding an element if it's a duplicate of the previous element and the previous element has not been used in the current recursion level.
