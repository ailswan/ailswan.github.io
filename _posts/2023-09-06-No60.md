### Problem Statement
**link:**
https://leetcode.com/problems/permutation-sequence/
https://leetcode.cn/problems/permutation-sequence/

The set [1, 2, 3, ..., n] contains a total of n! unique permutations.

By listing and labeling all of the permutations in order, we get the following sequence for n = 3:

"123"
"132"
"213"
"231"
"312"
"321"
Given n and k, return the kth permutation sequence.

**Example:**

**Input:** `n = 3, k = 3`
**Output:** `"213"`

**Input:** `n = 4, k = 9`
**Output:** `"2314"`

**Input:** `n = 3, k = 1`
**Output:** `"123"`


### Solution Approach

The solution leverages the factorial properties of permutations to determine the position of each number in the sequence.


#### Algorithm
 
1. Factorial and Number Array Initialization: First, generate two arrays: one (f) to store the factorials from 1 to n, and another (nums) to store numbers from 1 to n.
2. Calculation of Position: For each number from n down to 1, calculate the position (index) of the number in the nums array using the formula: index = k // f[i - 1], where f is the factorial array. Append the number at the calculated position to the result and remove it from the nums array.
3. K Value Update: Update k for the next iteration using the formula: k %= f[i - 1].
This algorithm constructs the permutation string by calculating the position of each digit one-by-one.
