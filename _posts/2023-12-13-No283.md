### Problem Statement
**link:**

[LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/move-zeroes/)

Given an integer array nums, move all 0's to the end of it while maintaining the relative order of the non-zero elements.

Note that you must do this in-place without making a copy of the array.

 
**Example:**

**Input:** `nums = [0,1,0,3,12]`
**Output:** `[1,3,12,0,0]`
 
**Input:** `nums = [0]`
**Output:** `[0]`

### Solution Approach
 
The solution approach for this problem involves using a two-pointer approach to iterate through the array and move non-zero elements to the beginning, maintaining their relative order, and filling the remaining positions with zeros.

#### Algorithm
1. Initialization: Set two pointers, i and j, both initially at 0.

2. Non-Zero Element Movement: Iterate through the array with i. When a non-zero element is found, move it to the position indicated by j and increment both pointers.

3. Fill with Zeros: After the first pass, continue with j to fill the remaining positions with zeros.
