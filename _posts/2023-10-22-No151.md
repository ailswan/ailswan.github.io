### Problem Statement
**link:**
https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-words-in-a-string/
https://leetcode.cn/problems/reverse-words-in-a-string/
 
Given an input string s, reverse the order of the words.

A word is defined as a sequence of non-space characters. The words in s will be separated by at least one space.

Return a string of the words in reverse order concatenated by a single space.

Note that s may contain leading or trailing spaces or multiple spaces between two words. The returned string should only have a single space separating the words. Do not include any extra spaces.

**Example:**

**Input:** `s = "the sky is blue"`
**Output:** `"blue is sky the"`
 
**Input:** `s = "  hello world  "`
**Output:** `"world hello"`

**Input:** `s = "a good   example"`
**Output:** `"example good a"`
 

### Solution Approach
The solution uses string manipulation methods to reverse the words while maintaining their order and removing extra spaces.

#### Algorithm
1. Splitting the String: Use Python's split method, which naturally discards any leading, trailing, or multiple spaces between words and splits the string into words.
2. Reversing the Words: Reverse the list of words obtained in the previous step.
3. Joining the Words: Join the reversed list of words using a space to form the final reversed string.
