### Problem Statement
**link:**

[LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/power-of-two/)
 
 
Given an integer n, return true if it is a power of two. Otherwise, return false.

An integer n is a power of two, if there exists an integer x such that n == 2x.


**Example:**

**Input:** `n = 1`
**Output:** `true`
 
**Input:** `n = 16`
**Output:** `true `

**Input:** `n = 3`
**Output:** `false`
 

### Solution Approach
Determine if a number is a power of two by repeatedly dividing it by 2.

#### Algorithm
1. If the number is less than or equal to 0, return false.
2. Repeatedly divide the number by 2 as long as it's evenly divisible.
3. If the number becomes 1 after divisions, it's a power of two; otherwise, return false.
