[LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/largest-divisible-subset/)

Given a set of distinct positive integers nums, return the largest subset answer such that every pair (answer[i], answer[j]) of elements in this subset satisfies:

answer[i] % answer[j] == 0, or
answer[j] % answer[i] == 0
If there are multiple solutions, return any of them.

 
**Example:**

**Input:** `nums = [1,2,3]`
**Output:** `[1,2]`
 
**Input:** `nums = [1,2,4,8]`
**Output:** `[1,2,4,8]`
