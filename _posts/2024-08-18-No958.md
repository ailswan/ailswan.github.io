### Problem Statement
**link:**
[LeetCode.cn](https://leetcode.cn/problems/check-completeness-of-a-binary-tree/)
[LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/check-completeness-of-a-binary-tree/)
Given the root of a binary tree, determine if it is a complete binary tree.

In a complete binary tree, every level, except possibly the last, is completely filled, and all nodes in the last level are as far left as possible. It can have between 1 and 2h nodes inclusive at the last level h.

**Example:**

**Input:** `root = [1,2,3,4,5,6]`
**Output:** `true`

**Input:** `root = [1,2,3,4,5,null,7]`
**Output:** `false`

**Constraints:**
The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [1, 100].
1 <= Node.val <= 1000
 
### Solution Approach
The solution uses a BFS approach to traverse the tree level by level, ensuring that no non-None nodes appear after a None, which would violate the completeness property of the binary tree.

#### Algorithm
1. Level Order Traversal: Perform a BFS traversal using a queue to visit each node level by level, ensuring that nodes are processed in the correct order.
2. Check for None Nodes: Track when a None node is encountered, indicating a potential gap in the tree, which should be followed only by other None nodes.
3. Validation: If any non-None node is found after a None, return False to indicate the tree is not complete; otherwise, if no violations are found, return True.
