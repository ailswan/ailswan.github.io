### Problem Statement

[LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/check-completeness-of-a-binary-tree/)
Given the root of a binary tree, determine if it is a complete binary tree.

In a complete binary tree, every level, except possibly the last, is completely filled, and all nodes in the last level are as far left as possible. It can have between 1 and 2h nodes inclusive at the last level h.

**Example:**

**Input:** `root = [1,2,3,4,5,6]`
**Output:** `true`

**Input:** `root = [1,2,3,4,5,null,7]`
**Output:** `false`

**Constraints:**
The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [1, 100].
1 <= Node.val <= 1000
