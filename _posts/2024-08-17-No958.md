    Definition for a binary tree node.
    class TreeNode:
        def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
            self.val = val
            self.left = left
            self.right = right
    class Solution:
        def isCompleteTree(self, root: Optional[TreeNode]) -> bool:
            empty = False
            q = deque([root])
            while q:
                node = q.popleft()
                if node is None:
                    empty = True
                else:
                    if empty:
                        return False
                    q.append(node.left)
                    q.append(node.right)
            return True

### Problem Statement
**link:**

[LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/check-completeness-of-a-binary-tree/)
Given the root of a binary tree, determine if it is a complete binary tree.

In a complete binary tree, every level, except possibly the last, is completely filled, and all nodes in the last level are as far left as possible. It can have between 1 and 2h nodes inclusive at the last level h.

**Example:**

**Input:** `root = [1,2,3,4,5,6]`
**Output:** `true`

**Input:** `root = [1,2,3,4,5,null,7]`
**Output:** `false`

**Constraints:**
The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [1, 100].
1 <= Node.val <= 1000
 
### Solution Approach
The algorithm uses BFS to traverse the tree level by level, ensuring that after encountering a None node, all subsequent nodes must also be None to confirm the tree's completeness.
#### Algorithm
1. BFS Traversal: Use a queue to perform a level-order traversal of the binary tree.
2. Check for Completeness: Track if a None node is encountered, and ensure no subsequent non-None nodes appear.
3. Validation: If any non-None node is found after a None, the tree is not complete; otherwise, it is.
