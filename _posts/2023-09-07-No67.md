### Problem Statement
**link:**
https://leetcode.com/problems/add-binary/
https://leetcode.cn/problems/add-binary/


Given two binary strings a and b, return their sum as a binary string.


**Example:**

**Input:** `a = "11", b = "1"`
**Output:** `"100"`

**Input:** `a = "1010", b = "1011"`
**Output:** `"10101"`


### Solution Approach

The solution involves simulating the process of binary addition bit-by-bit, considering the carry from one bit to the next. 

#### Algorithm
1. Padding: Equalize the lengths of both binary strings by adding leading zeros to the shorter one.
2. Bitwise Addition: Iterate from rightmost bit to leftmost, adding corresponding bits from both strings and any carry from the previous step.
3. Handle Final Carry: If there's a remaining carry after all bits are processed, prepend "1" to the result.
