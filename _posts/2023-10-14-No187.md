### Problem Statement
**link:**
https://leetcode.com/problems/repeated-dna-sequences/
https://leetcode.cn/problems/repeated-dna-sequences/
 
The DNA sequence is composed of a series of nucleotides abbreviated as 'A', 'C', 'G', and 'T'.

For example, "ACGAATTCCG" is a DNA sequence.
When studying DNA, it is useful to identify repeated sequences within the DNA.

Given a string s that represents a DNA sequence, return all the 10-letter-long sequences (substrings) that occur more than once in a DNA molecule. You may return the answer in any order.

**Example:**

**Input:** `s = "AAAAACCCCCAAAAACCCCCCAAAAAGGGTTT"`
**Output:** `["AAAAACCCCC","CCCCCAAAAA"]`
 
**Input:** `s = "AAAAAAAAAAAAA"`
**Output:** `["AAAAAAAAAA"]`
 

### Solution Approach
