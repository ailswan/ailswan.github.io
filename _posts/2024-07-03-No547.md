### Problem Statement
**link:**
[LeetCode.cn](https://leetcode.cn/problems/number-of-provinces/)
[LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/number-of-provinces/)
There are n cities. Some of them are connected, while some are not. If city a is connected directly with city b, and city b is connected directly with city c, then city a is connected indirectly with city c.

A province is a group of directly or indirectly connected cities and no other cities outside of the group.

You are given an n x n matrix isConnected where isConnected[i][j] = 1 if the ith city and the jth city are directly connected, and isConnected[i][j] = 0 otherwise.

Return the total number of provinces.

**Example:**

**Input:** `isConnected = [[1,1,0],[1,1,0],[0,0,1]]`
**Output:** `2`

**Input:** `isConnected = [[1,0,0],[0,1,0],[0,0,1]]`
**Output:** `3`
 
### Solution Approach
The solution can be approached using Depth-First Search (DFS), Breadth-First Search (BFS), or Union-Find to traverse the graph represented by the adjacency matrix and count the number of connected components or provinces.

#### Algorithm
1. Depth-First Search (DFS): Traverse the graph using DFS to mark all cities connected to a starting city as visited, and count each DFS initiation as a new province.
2. Breadth-First Search (BFS): Use a queue to perform BFS, marking connected cities as visited, and count each BFS initiation as a new province.
3. Union-Find: Utilize the Union-Find data structure to merge sets of connected cities and count the number of unique sets to determine the number of provinces.
