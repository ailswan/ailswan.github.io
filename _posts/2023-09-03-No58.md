### Problem Statement
**link:**

https://leetcode.cn/problems/length-of-last-word/description/

Given a string s consisting of words and spaces, return the length of the last word in the string.

A word is a maximal 
substring consisting of non-space characters only.


**Example:**

**Input:** `"Hello World"`
**Output:** `5`

**Input:** `  fly me   to   the moon  `
**Output:** `4`

**Input:** `"luffy is still joyboy"`
**Output:** `6`


### Solution Approach

The solution involves trimming trailing spaces and identifying the last word in the string to measure its length.

#### Algorithm

1. Trimming: Remove any leading or trailing spaces from the string using the strip() method.
2. Splitting: Break the string into words using the split(" ") method.
3. Last Word Length: Retrieve the last word from the split list and return its length using the len() function.
