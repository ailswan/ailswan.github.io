### Problem Statement

https://leetcode.cn/problems/product-of-array-except-self/
 
Given an integer array nums, return an array answer such that answer[i] is equal to the product of all the elements of nums except nums[i].

The product of any prefix or suffix of nums is guaranteed to fit in a 32-bit integer.

You must write an algorithm that runs in O(n) time and without using the division operation.

**Example:**

**Input:** `nums = [1,2,3,4]`
**Output:** `[24,12,8,6]`
 
**Input:** `nums = [-1,1,0,-3,3]`
**Output:** `[0,0,9,0,0]`
