### Problem Statement
**link:**

https://leetcode.cn/problems/word-ladder/

A transformation sequence from word beginWord to word endWord using a dictionary wordList is a sequence of words beginWord -> s1 -> s2 -> ... -> sk such that:

Every adjacent pair of words differs by a single letter.
Every si for 1 <= i <= k is in wordList. Note that beginWord does not need to be in wordList.
sk == endWord
Given two words, beginWord and endWord, and a dictionary wordList, return the number of words in the shortest transformation sequence from beginWord to endWord, or 0 if no such sequence exists.

 
**Example:**

**Input:** `beginWord = "hit", endWord = "cog", wordList = ["hot","dot","dog","lot","log","cog"]`
**Output:** `5`
 
**Input:** `beginWord = "hit", endWord = "cog", wordList = ["hot","dot","dog","lot","log"]`
**Output:** `0`
