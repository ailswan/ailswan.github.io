### Problem Statement
**link:**

[LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/word-pattern/)

Given a pattern and a string s, find if s follows the same pattern.

Here follow means a full match, such that there is a bijection between a letter in pattern and a non-empty word in s.

 
**Example:**

**Input:** `pattern = "abba", s = "dog cat cat dog"`
**Output:** `true`
 
**Input:** `pattern = "abba", s = "dog cat cat fish"`
**Output:** `false`

**Input:** `pattern = "aaaa", s = "dog cat cat dog"`
**Output:** `false`

### Solution Approach
This problem can be efficiently solved by utilizing two dictionaries to establish a bijection between each character in the pattern and each word in the string.

#### Algorithm
1. Split the string s into individual words and initialize two empty dictionaries, dic1 and dic2, to store mappings between characters and words.
2. Iterate through each character p in pattern and each word w in the list of words simultaneously:
3. If all mappings are consistent without any discrepancies, return True, indicating that s follows the same pattern as pattern.
