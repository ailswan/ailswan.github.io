### Problem Statement

[LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/maximum-swap/)
Given an unsorted array of integers nums, return the length of the longest continuous increasing subsequence (i.e. subarray). The subsequence must be strictly increasing.

A continuous increasing subsequence is defined by two indices l and r (l < r) such that it is [nums[l], nums[l + 1], ..., nums[r - 1], nums[r]] and for each l <= i < r, nums[i] < nums[i + 1].
 
**Example:**

**Input:** `nums = [1,3,5,4,7]`
**Output:** `3`

**Input:** `nums = [2,2,2,2,2]`
**Output:** `1`

**Constraints:**
1 <= nums.length <= 104
-109 <= nums[i] <= 109
 
### Solution Approach
The solution iteratively expands the right boundary of a sliding window while tracking the longest continuous increasing subsequence, resetting the left boundary whenever the sequence stops increasing.

#### Algorithm
1. Initialize Pointers and Variables: Start with two pointers, l and r, both at the beginning of the array, and initialize a variable res to keep track of the maximum length of any increasing subsequence found.
2. Expand the Right Pointer: Move the right pointer r forward while the sequence is strictly increasing (nums[r + 1] > nums[r]). Update the maximum length res when the sequence ends.
3. Reset Pointers: Once the sequence stops increasing, move both pointers to the next position (l = r + 1) and repeat the process until the entire array is scanned. Return the maximum length res as the result.
