### Problem Statement
**link:**
[LeetCode.cn](https://leetcode.cn/problems/smallest-subtree-with-all-the-deepest-nodes/)
[LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/smallest-subtree-with-all-the-deepest-nodes/)
Given the root of a binary tree, the depth of each node is the shortest distance to the root.

Return the smallest subtree such that it contains all the deepest nodes in the original tree.

A node is called the deepest if it has the largest depth possible among any node in the entire tree.

The subtree of a node is a tree consisting of that node, plus the set of all descendants of that node.

**Example:**

**Input:** `root = [3,5,1,6,2,0,8,null,null,7,4]`
**Output:** `[2,7,4]`

**Input:** `root = [1]`
**Output:** `[1]`

**Input:** `root = [0,1,3,null,2]`
**Output:** `[2]`
