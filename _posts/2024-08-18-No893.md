### Problem Statement
**link:**
[LeetCode.cn](https://leetcode.cn/problems/groups-of-special-equivalent-strings/)
[LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/groups-of-special-equivalent-strings/)
You are given an array of strings of the same length words.

In one move, you can swap any two even indexed characters or any two odd indexed characters of a string words[i].

Two strings words[i] and words[j] are special-equivalent if after any number of moves, words[i] == words[j].

For example, words[i] = "zzxy" and words[j] = "xyzz" are special-equivalent because we may make the moves "zzxy" -> "xzzy" -> "xyzz".
A group of special-equivalent strings from words is a non-empty subset of words such that:

Every pair of strings in the group are special equivalent, and
The group is the largest size possible (i.e., there is not a string words[i] not in the group such that words[i] is special-equivalent to every string in the group).
Return the number of groups of special-equivalent strings from words.


**Example:**

**Input:** `words = ["abcd","cdab","cbad","xyzz","zzxy","zzyx"]`
**Output:** `3`

**Input:** `words = ["abc","acb","bac","bca","cab","cba"]`
**Output:** `3`

**Constraints:**
1 <= words.length <= 1000
1 <= words[i].length <= 20
words[i] consist of lowercase English letters.
All the strings are of the same length.
 
### Solution Approach
To solve this problem, categorize each string by creating a tuple that represents the frequency of characters at even and odd indices, then count the number of unique tuples to determine the number of special-equivalent groups.

#### Algorithm
1. Character Frequency Counting: For each string, create a frequency tuple for characters at even indices and odd indices separately, then combine these counts into a single tuple.
2. Unique Tuple Representation: Use a set to collect these tuples for all strings, as each unique tuple represents a distinct group of special-equivalent strings.
3. Group Count: The number of unique tuples in the set corresponds to the number of special-equivalent groups in the input list of strings.
