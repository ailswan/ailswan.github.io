### Problem Statement
**link:**
https://leetcode.com/problems/count-complete-tree-nodes/
https://leetcode.cn/problems/count-complete-tree-nodes/
 
Given the root of a complete binary tree, return the number of the nodes in the tree.

According to Wikipedia, every level, except possibly the last, is completely filled in a complete binary tree, and all nodes in the last level are as far left as possible. It can have between 1 and 2h nodes inclusive at the last level h.

Design an algorithm that runs in less than O(n) time complexity.

**Example:**

**Input:** `root = [1,2,3,4,5,6]`
**Output:** `6`
 
**Input:** `root = []`
**Output:** `0`
 
**Input:** `root = [1]`
**Output:** `1`
