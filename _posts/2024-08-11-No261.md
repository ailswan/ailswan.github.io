### Problem Statement
**link:**
[LeetCode.cn](https://leetcode.cn/problems/graph-valid-tree)
[LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/graph-valid-tree/)
ou have a graph of n nodes labeled from 0 to n - 1. You are given an integer n and a list of edges where edges[i] = [ai, bi] indicates that there is an undirected edge between nodes ai and bi in the graph.

Return true if the edges of the given graph make up a valid tree, and false otherwise.

**Example:**

**Input:** `n = 5, edges = [[0,1],[0,2],[0,3],[1,4]]`
**Output:** `true`

**Input:** `n = 5, edges = [[0,1],[1,2],[2,3],[1,3],[1,4]]`
**Output:** `false`

**Constraints:** 
1 <= n <= 2000
0 <= edges.length <= 5000
edges[i].length == 2
0 <= ai, bi < n
ai != bi
There are no self-loops or repeated edges.
 
### Solution Approach
The solution checks if the graph is connected and acyclic by performing a depth-first search (DFS) from an initial node and verifying that all nodes are visited and the graph has exactly n - 1 edges.

#### Algorithm
1. Edge Count Check: Ensure the number of edges is exactly n - 1, which is a necessary condition for a valid tree.
2. DFS for Acyclic Property: Use depth-first search (DFS) to detect cycles and confirm that the graph is acyclic by checking if any node is revisited.
3. Connectedness Verification: Verify that all nodes are visited during the DFS, ensuring that the graph is fully connected.
