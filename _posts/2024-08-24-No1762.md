### Problem Statement

[LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/buildings-with-an-ocean-view/)
There are n buildings in a line. You are given an integer array heights of size n that represents the heights of the buildings in the line.

The ocean is to the right of the buildings. A building has an ocean view if the building can see the ocean without obstructions. Formally, a building has an ocean view if all the buildings to its right have a smaller height.

Return a list of indices (0-indexed) of buildings that have an ocean view, sorted in increasing order.

**Example:**

**Input:** `heights = [4,2,3,1]`
**Output:** `[0,2,3]`

**Input:** `heights = [4,3,2,1]`
**Output:** `[0,1,2,3]`

**Input:** `heights = [1,3,2,4]`
**Output:** `[3]`


**Constraints:**
1 <= heights.length <= 105
1 <= heights[i] <= 109
