### Problem Statement
**link:**
[LeetCode.cn](https://leetcode.cn/problems/accounts-merge/)
[LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/accounts-merge/)
Given a list of accounts where each element accounts[i] is a list of strings, where the first element accounts[i][0] is a name, and the rest of the elements are emails representing emails of the account.

Now, we would like to merge these accounts. Two accounts definitely belong to the same person if there is some common email to both accounts. Note that even if two accounts have the same name, they may belong to different people as people could have the same name. A person can have any number of accounts initially, but all of their accounts definitely have the same name.

After merging the accounts, return the accounts in the following format: the first element of each account is the name, and the rest of the elements are emails in sorted order. The accounts themselves can be returned in any order.

**Example:**

**Input:** `accounts = [["John","johnsmith@mail.com","john_newyork@mail.com"],["John","johnsmith@mail.com","john00@mail.com"],["Mary","mary@mail.com"],["John","johnnybravo@mail.com"]]`
**Output:** `[["John","john00@mail.com","john_newyork@mail.com","johnsmith@mail.com"],["Mary","mary@mail.com"],["John","johnnybravo@mail.com"]]`

**Input:** `accounts = [["Gabe","Gabe0@m.co","Gabe3@m.co","Gabe1@m.co"],["Kevin","Kevin3@m.co","Kevin5@m.co","Kevin0@m.co"],["Ethan","Ethan5@m.co","Ethan4@m.co","Ethan0@m.co"],["Hanzo","Hanzo3@m.co","Hanzo1@m.co","Hanzo0@m.co"],["Fern","Fern5@m.co","Fern1@m.co","Fern0@m.co"]]`
**Output:** `[["Ethan","Ethan0@m.co","Ethan4@m.co","Ethan5@m.co"],["Gabe","Gabe0@m.co","Gabe1@m.co","Gabe3@m.co"],["Hanzo","Hanzo0@m.co","Hanzo1@m.co","Hanzo3@m.co"],["Kevin","Kevin0@m.co","Kevin3@m.co","Kevin5@m.co"],["Fern","Fern0@m.co","Fern1@m.co","Fern5@m.co"]]`

**Constraints:**
1 <= accounts.length <= 1000
2 <= accounts[i].length <= 10
1 <= accounts[i][j].length <= 30
accounts[i][0] consists of English letters.
accounts[i][j] (for j > 0) is a valid email.

### Solution Approach
The solution uses the Union-Find data structure to group emails belonging to the same person by finding and merging connected components based on shared emails, then maps these groups back to their corresponding names and sorts the emails within each group.

#### Algorithm
1. Email Mapping and Indexing: Each email is assigned a unique index, and emails are mapped to their corresponding account name to facilitate the grouping process.
2. Union-Find to Merge Accounts: The Union-Find structure is used to connect emails that belong to the same account by finding the root email for each group and merging them based on shared emails across different accounts.
3. Grouping and Sorting: After merging, emails with the same root are grouped together, then sorted, and combined with their associated account name to form the final output.
