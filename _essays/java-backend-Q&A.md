### Java backend Q&A

### **Why is multiple inheritance not possible in Java?**:
 In Java, multiple inheritance isn't supported due to the ambiguity problem. Multiple inheritance is also not supported in Java to simplify the language and reduce the complexity.

One example of a problem that occurs in multiple inheritance is the diamond problem.
