# gRPC 

1. **What is gRPC?**
   - **Answer:** gRPC is an open-source RPC (Remote Procedure Call) framework developed by Google. It uses HTTP/2 for transport, Protocol Buffers as the interface description language, and provides features such as bidirectional streaming and multiplexing.

2. **Explain Protocol Buffers (ProtoBuf).**
   - **Answer:** Protocol Buffers is a method for serializing structured data. It is language-agnostic, platform-neutral, and used by gRPC to define the structure of the data that is sent between the client and server.

3. **How does gRPC differ from RESTful APIs?**
   - **Answer:** gRPC uses HTTP/2 as the transport protocol, whereas RESTful APIs typically use HTTP/1.1. gRPC supports bidirectional streaming, multiplexing, and Protocol Buffers for data serialization, providing better performance compared to RESTful APIs.

4. **Explain the types of RPC in gRPC.**
   - **Answer:** gRPC supports four types of RPC:
     - Unary: Single request and single response.
     - Server streaming: Single request and multiple responses.
     - Client streaming: Multiple requests and single response.
     - Bidirectional streaming: Multiple requests and multiple responses.

5. **What are the advantages of gRPC over REST?**
   - **Answer:** gRPC offers advantages such as better performance due to HTTP/2, automatic generation of client libraries, strong typing with Protocol Buffers, and support for bidirectional streaming.

6. **How does gRPC handle errors?**
   - **Answer:** gRPC uses status codes similar to HTTP status codes to indicate the success or failure of an RPC. Additionally, it allows attaching metadata to the response for more detailed error information.

7. **Explain the concept of Middleware in gRPC.**
   - **Answer:** Middleware in gRPC allows developers to intercept and manipulate messages during the request/response flow. It can be used for tasks such as authentication, logging, and instrumentation.

8. **What is the role of a proto file in gRPC?**
   - **Answer:** A proto file in gRPC defines the structure of messages and services using Protocol Buffers syntax. It serves as a contract between the client and server, specifying the data that can be exchanged and the available RPC methods.

9. **How does gRPC handle security?**
   - **Answer:** gRPC provides built-in support for transport security using TLS/SSL. It also allows the implementation of custom authentication mechanisms.

10. **Explain the concept of Deadlines/Timeouts in gRPC.**
    - **Answer:** Deadlines or timeouts in gRPC specify the maximum time a client is willing to wait for an RPC to complete. If the deadline is exceeded, the RPC is terminated.

# RESTful API 

1. **What is REST?**
   - **Answer:** REST (Representational State Transfer) is an architectural style for designing networked applications. It uses a stateless communication model and standard HTTP methods for data manipulation.

2. **Explain the key principles of REST.**
   - **Answer:** The key principles of REST include statelessness, client-server architecture, cacheability, uniform interface, layered system, and code on demand (optional).

3. **How does REST differ from SOAP?**
   - **Answer:** REST is an architectural style using standard HTTP methods and is often more lightweight. SOAP is a protocol with a strict specification, using XML for message format, and typically relies on HTTP or SMTP.

4. **What are HTTP methods in REST, and how do they map to CRUD operations?**
   - **Answer:** HTTP methods in REST include GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, and DELETE. They map to CRUD operations as follows:
     - GET: Read
     - POST: Create
     - PUT/PATCH: Update
     - DELETE: Delete

5. **Explain the concept of RESTful URIs.**
   - **Answer:** RESTful URIs are resource identifiers designed to be human-readable and represent resources in the system. They follow a hierarchical structure and should be nouns rather than verbs.

6. **What is the role of HTTP status codes in REST?**
   - **Answer:** HTTP status codes indicate the success or failure of an HTTP request. Common status codes include 200 (OK), 201 (Created), 204 (No Content), 400 (Bad Request), 404 (Not Found), and 500 (Internal Server Error).

7. **What is content negotiation in REST?**
   - **Answer:** Content negotiation is the process of selecting the most appropriate representation of a resource based on the client's preferences. It involves the use of the `Accept` header in the HTTP request.

8. **Explain the difference between PUT and PATCH in REST.**
   - **Answer:** PUT is used to update or create a resource entirely, while PATCH is used to update part of a resource. PUT replaces the entire resource, while PATCH applies partial modifications.

9. **What is HATEOAS in REST?**
   - **Answer:** HATEOAS (Hypermedia as the Engine of Application State) is a principle in REST that suggests clients interact with a network application entirely through hypermedia provided dynamically by the application servers.

10. **What are the advantages of RESTful APIs?**
    - **Answer:** Advantages of RESTful APIs include simplicity, scalability, statelessness, ease of caching, and compatibility with various data formats such as JSON and XML.

11. **Explain the role of HTTP headers in RESTful communication.**
    - **Answer:** HTTP headers carry metadata about the request or response. Common headers include `Content-Type`, `Accept`, `Authorization`, and `Cache-Control`.

12. **What are the common authentication methods used in RESTful APIs?**
    - **Answer:** Common authentication methods include API keys, OAuth, and JWT (JSON Web Tokens).

13. **How does REST handle versioning?**
    - **Answer:** Versioning in REST can be done through URI versioning (`/v1/resource`), custom headers, or media type versioning.

14. **What is Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) in the context of RESTful APIs?**
    - **Answer:** CORS is a security feature implemented in web browsers that allows or restricts web applications running at one origin to access resources from a different origin.

15. **Explain idempotence and why it's important in REST.**
    - **Answer:** Idempotence means that an operation produces the same result whether executed once or multiple times. It's important in REST to ensure that repeating a request has the same effect as making it once, preventing unintended side effects.

# Raw Sockets 

1. **What are raw sockets?**
   - **Answer:** Raw sockets provide a low-level programming interface for network communication, allowing applications to send and receive data directly at the transport layer without the need for higher-level protocols.

2. **How do raw sockets differ from higher-level abstractions like gRPC or REST?**
   - **Answer:** Raw sockets operate at a lower level, providing a direct interface to the network stack. Unlike gRPC or REST, they don't have built-in abstractions for RPC or standardized message formats.

3. **What is the role of sockets in network programming?**
   - **Answer:** Sockets are endpoints for network communication. They enable processes on different devices to communicate over a network by providing a programming interface for sending and receiving data.

4. **Explain the difference between TCP and UDP sockets.**
   - **Answer:** TCP sockets provide reliable, connection-oriented communication, ensuring data integrity and order. UDP sockets offer a connectionless, lightweight communication model with no guarantees regarding delivery or order.

5. **How does socket programming handle data serialization and deserialization?**
   - **Answer:** Raw sockets do not inherently handle data serialization. It's the responsibility of the developer to serialize data into a format suitable for transmission and deserialize it on the receiving end.

6. **What is the significance of the socket address (IP address and port number) in networking?**
   - **Answer:** The socket address uniquely identifies a process on a network. It consists of an IP address and port number, allowing data to be directed to the correct application running on a device.

7. **How does socket communication handle error detection and correction?**
   - **Answer:** Error detection and correction are typically handled at higher layers of the protocol stack. Raw sockets don't provide built-in error detection or correction mechanisms; developers must implement these if needed.

8. **Explain the concept of blocking and non-blocking sockets.**
   - **Answer:** In blocking sockets, a process is halted until data is ready to be sent or received. Non-blocking sockets allow a process to continue executing even if no data is available, checking periodically for data readiness.

9. **What are the security considerations when using raw sockets?**
   - **Answer:** Raw sockets provide a powerful but potentially risky interface. Security measures such as proper input validation, encryption, and authentication must be implemented to prevent vulnerabilities and unauthorized access.

10. **How can sockets be used for inter-process communication (IPC) on a local machine?**
    - **Answer:** Sockets can be used for IPC by creating local sockets that allow communication between different processes on the same machine using protocols such as Unix domain sockets.

11. **Explain the concept of socket options.**
    - **Answer:** Socket options are parameters that can be set or retrieved to control the behavior of sockets. Examples include setting socket timeout, enabling/disabling features, or configuring socket buffer sizes.

12. **What is the significance of the socket buffer in networking?**
    - **Answer:** Socket buffers are used to temporarily store data during transmission. Proper buffer management is essential for optimizing data transfer and preventing data loss or overflow.

13. **How does socket programming handle concurrent connections?**
    - **Answer:** Handling concurrent connections typically involves using threading or asynchronous programming. Developers must manage multiple sockets, possibly using mechanisms like select or poll.

14. **What is the role of the transport layer in socket communication?**
    - **Answer:** The transport layer ensures reliable and orderly data transfer between devices. It includes protocols like TCP (connection-oriented) and UDP (connectionless), providing different trade-offs between reliability and efficiency.

15. **Explain the concept of socket polling.**
    - **Answer:** Socket polling involves periodically checking whether a socket is ready for reading or writing. It allows efficient handling of multiple sockets without blocking the entire program.
