## Contraints &  Strategies
| **Constraint**              | **Range**                                     | **Strategy**                                                                                                                                     |

| **Input Size**              | \(n \leq 10^3\)                               | Use \(O(n^2)\) algorithms like brute-force, nested loops, etc.                                                                                   |
|                             | \(n \leq 10^5\)                               | Consider \(O(n \log n)\) algorithms like quicksort, mergesort, binary search, etc.                                                               |
|                             | \(n \leq 10^7\)                               | Opt for \(O(n)\) or lower complexity algorithms like linear scans, hash operations, or divide-and-conquer strategies.                            |
| **Time Complexity**         | \(t \leq 1\) second                           | Keep the algorithm’s complexity within \(O(n \log n)\) or \(O(n)\) to handle up to \(10^8\) or \(10^9\) operations per second.                   |
|                             | Real-time processing                          | Select algorithms with low time complexity, possibly using greedy algorithms, dynamic programming, etc.                                           |

| **Data Characteristics**    | Data is already sorted                        | Leverage sorted data using techniques like binary search or two-pointer methods.                                                                  |
|                             | High amount of duplicate data                 | Use hash maps or sets to remove duplicates, or apply greedy strategies to avoid unnecessary computations.                                         |
|                             | Sparse data                                   | Employ sparse matrices or compressed storage to reduce space complexity, or optimize using the sparse characteristics, such as skip lists.        |
| **Special Operation Needs** | Frequent lookups                              | Use hash tables (O(1) lookup) or balanced binary search trees (O(log n) lookup) to optimize search operations.                                    |
|                             | Frequent updates                              | Use dynamic data structures like heaps, segment trees, or balanced trees to enable quick updates and queries.                                     |
| **Parallelism**             | Can be distributed                            | Split the task into independent subtasks and process them in parallel using multithreading or distributed systems, suitable for large-scale data. |
|                             | Single-threaded                               | Focus on sequential optimization, reducing the number of loops and redundant calculations.                                                       |
| **Algorithm Robustness**    | Extreme cases or abnormal data                | Design the algorithm to handle edge cases, ensuring correct operation with empty inputs, extreme values, etc. Add input validation for robustness. |
