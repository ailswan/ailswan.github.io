### Essays

#### The Importance of Taking Notes

Notes play a crucial role in capturing thoughts, ideas, and observations. They act as a reflection of our cognitive processes and can be instrumental in consolidating our learnings. Read more about this in the essay [The Science Behind Taking Notes](#).

#### Digital vs. Traditional Notetaking

In the age of technology, the debate between digital and traditional note-taking intensifies. This essay delves into the pros and cons of both methods, drawing insights from various research. Check out [Digital vs. Analog: A Comprehensive Comparison](#).

### Example Code

In the world of programming, 'notes' often manifest as comments. Here's a simple Python code to demonstrate:

```python
def add(a, b):
    # This function adds two numbers
    return a + b

# Sample usage
result = add(10, 20)
print(f"The sum is {result}")  # Outputs: The sum is 30
