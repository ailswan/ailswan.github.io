### Problem Statement

[LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/confusing-number/)

A confusing number is a number that when rotated 180 degrees becomes a different number with each digit valid.

We can rotate digits of a number by 180 degrees to form new digits.

When 0, 1, 6, 8, and 9 are rotated 180 degrees, they become 0, 1, 9, 8, and 6 respectively.
When 2, 3, 4, 5, and 7 are rotated 180 degrees, they become invalid.
Note that after rotating a number, we can ignore leading zeros.

For example, after rotating 8000, we have 0008 which is considered as just 8.
Given an integer n, return true if it is a confusing number, or false otherwise.

 
 
**Example:**

**Input:** `n = 6`
**Output:** `true`
 
**Input:** `n = 89`
**Output:** `true`

**Input:** `n = 1`
**Output:** `flase`
