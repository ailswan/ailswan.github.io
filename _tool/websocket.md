## WebSocket
WebSocket is a communication protocol that enables full-duplex, bidirectional communication between clients and servers over a single TCP connection. Unlike HTTP, WebSocket allows real-time data exchange with minimal overhead, making it ideal for applications that require frequent updates.

### Why Choose WebSocket?
- **Real-time communication:** WebSocket enables instant data exchange, making it ideal for chat applications, gaming, financial tickers, and live updates.
- **Efficient:** Reduces the overhead associated with traditional HTTP polling or long-polling, as WebSocket connections remain open and active.
- **Low latency:** Provides faster response times compared to other communication methods, ensuring minimal delay in data transmission.
- **Bidirectional:** Allows both the server and client to send data to each other independently, without needing to initiate new requests.

### Configuration Tips:
- **Handshake:** Establish a WebSocket connection by upgrading an HTTP request using the `Upgrade` header, transitioning from HTTP to WebSocket.
- **Ping/pong:** Implement periodic ping/pong frames to keep the connection alive and detect dropped connections.
- **Security:** Use WebSocket Secure (`wss://`) to encrypt data over the connection, ensuring that sensitive information is protected.
- **Error handling:** Monitor and handle connection drops or errors gracefully to ensure smooth reconnection when the network is unstable.

### Example:
- **Chat application:** Implement WebSocket to handle real-time messaging between users, allowing messages to be instantly sent and received without reloading the page.
- **Live updates:** Use WebSocket in a stock price tracker to provide users with real-time updates on price changes, ensuring they receive the most up-to-date information.
- **Multiplayer game:** Develop an online multiplayer game where WebSocket is used to handle real-time interaction between players, ensuring low-latency communication.
