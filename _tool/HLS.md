## HLS (HTTP Live Streaming)
HLS (HTTP Live Streaming) is a media streaming protocol developed by Apple that allows for the transmission of live and on-demand video content over the internet. It uses adaptive bitrate streaming to deliver video content in varying quality based on the user's network conditions, ensuring an optimal viewing experience.

### Why Choose HLS?
- **Adaptive bitrate streaming:** HLS automatically adjusts the quality of video streams to match the viewer's network conditions, ensuring smooth playback even on slower connections.
- **Widely supported:** HLS is supported on a wide range of devices and platforms, including iOS, Android, macOS, Windows, and various smart TVs.
- **Scalability:** HLS uses standard HTTP servers, making it scalable and easier to distribute content globally using CDNs.
- **Resilience:** HLS segments video into small chunks, allowing for seamless recovery from network interruptions without major playback issues.

### Configuration Tips:
- **Segment duration:** Define segment duration in your HLS playlist to balance between latency and buffering. Shorter segments reduce latency, while longer ones reduce HTTP request overhead.
- **Adaptive bitrate:** Encode multiple bitrate versions of the same video to allow adaptive streaming. Include these versions in the HLS master playlist.
- **Encryption:** Implement AES-128 encryption for secure video delivery, ensuring content protection during streaming.
- **Latency control:** For live streaming, configure the stream for low-latency HLS to reduce delay, providing near real-time interaction for live events.

### Example:
- **Live streaming:** Use HLS for live sports broadcasts, where adaptive bitrate streaming ensures viewers can watch in the highest quality their network supports, even during high traffic.
- **Video on-demand:** Implement HLS to deliver on-demand video content across devices, providing a smooth user experience with adaptive streaming.
- **E-learning platform:** Stream educational videos using HLS, ensuring students with varying internet speeds receive the best quality without interruptions.
