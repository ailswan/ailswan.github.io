## Scalability

Scalability refers to the system's ability to handle increasing loads, ensuring performance and reliability as demand grows.

### Types of Scalability:
- **Vertical Scalability** (Scaling up): Adding more power (CPU, RAM) to an existing machine.
- **Horizontal Scalability** (Scaling out): Adding more machines or instances to the system.

### Key Considerations:
- **Load Balancing**: Distribute the load evenly across servers.
- **Distributed Systems**: Architect systems to scale across multiple servers.
