#### Multiple Server Instances
Definition: Running multiple copies of the application on different servers to handle incoming requests.
Benefits:
High Availability: If one server goes down, others can continue to serve users, minimizing downtime.
Load Distribution: Incoming traffic can be balanced across several instances, preventing any single server from becoming a bottleneck.
Scalability: Additional server instances can be easily added to handle increased traffic or load.
Implementation: Use a load balancer to distribute user requests evenly across all available server instances.
