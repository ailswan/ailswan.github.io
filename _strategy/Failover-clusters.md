## Failover Clusters
Failover clusters are a group of independent servers that work together to increase the availability and reliability of applications and services. If one server (node) in the cluster fails, the workload is automatically transferred to another node, ensuring minimal downtime.

### Why Choose Failover Clusters?
- **High Availability:** Failover clusters ensure that critical applications and services remain available, even in the event of hardware or software failures.
- **Redundancy:** By duplicating resources across multiple nodes, failover clusters provide redundancy, allowing seamless recovery from failures.
- **Load Balancing:** Some cluster configurations support load balancing, distributing workloads evenly across multiple nodes to optimize performance.

### Trade-off Considerations:
- **Cost:** Implementing failover clusters can be expensive due to the need for additional hardware, software licenses, and maintenance.
- **Complexity:** Managing and configuring clusters can be complex, requiring specialized knowledge and training for IT staff.
- **Resource Utilization:** Inactive nodes in a cluster may lead to underutilization of resources if not configured properly.

### Configuration Tips:
- **Node Configuration:** Choose nodes with similar hardware specifications to ensure consistent performance across the cluster.
- **Shared Storage:** Utilize shared storage solutions (e.g., SAN) to ensure all nodes have access to the same data.
- **Monitoring:** Implement monitoring tools to continuously check the health of cluster nodes and alert administrators to potential issues.

### Example Applications:
- **Database Services:** Use failover clusters to ensure high availability for critical databases, such as SQL Server or Oracle, minimizing downtime during maintenance or failures.
- **Web Services:** Implement failover clusters for web applications to maintain service availability during server outages, providing a seamless experience for users.
- **Virtualization Platforms:** Utilize failover clusters in virtualized environments to provide high availability for virtual machines, ensuring continuous operation of critical workloads.
