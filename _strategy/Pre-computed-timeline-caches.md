## Pre-computed Timeline Caches
Pre-computed timeline caches are a strategy used to optimize the performance of systems where users frequently request personalized or dynamic data, such as in a social media platform (e.g., Twitter or Facebook). The timeline cache is a ready-made, pre-assembled set of posts, tweets, or updates that a user would typically see on their feed, created in advance rather than being generated in real-time upon each request.
