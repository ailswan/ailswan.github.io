#### Data Replication Across Regions
Definition: Storing copies of the database in multiple geographic locations to ensure data availability.
Benefits:
Disaster Recovery: If one data center experiences an outage, data remains accessible from another region, ensuring continuity of service.
Reduced Latency: Users can access data from the nearest geographic location, resulting in faster response times.
Data Consistency: While achieving replication, strategies such as eventual consistency or strong consistency models can be employed to ensure users have a coherent view of data.
Implementation: Utilize database technologies that support multi-region replication (e.g., Cassandra, MongoDB) to automatically manage data across different locations.
