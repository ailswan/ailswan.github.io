### 4. Ticketmaster System Design

üéüÔ∏è **What is Ticketmaster?**  
Ticketmaster is an online platform for purchasing tickets to live entertainment events, including concerts, sports, and theater.

---

## **Understanding the Problem**

Ticketmaster needs to handle millions of users searching for and booking tickets simultaneously. Designing a system to ensure availability, consistency, and scalability is critical.

---

### **Functional Requirements**

1. Users should be able to view events.
2. Users should be able to search for events.
3. Users should be able to book tickets to events.

**Below the line (out of scope):**
- Users should be able to view their booked events.
- Event coordinators should be able to add events.
- Dynamic pricing for popular events.

---

### **Non-Functional Requirements**

1. The system should prioritize availability for searching & viewing events but prioritize consistency for booking (no double bookings).
2. The system should be scalable to handle high traffic during popular events.
3. Low latency in search (< 500ms).
4. The system should support high read throughput.

**Below the line (out of scope):**
- GDPR compliance.
- Fault tolerance.
- Secure transactions and regular backups.

---

## **Defining Core Entities**

1. **Event**: Stores event details like date, description, type, and performer.
2. **User**: Represents individuals interacting with the system.
3. **Performer**: Represents artists or teams.
4. **Venue**: Stores location and seating capacity.
5. **Ticket**: Tracks event seat availability and pricing.
6. **Booking**: Tracks user ticket purchases and payment statuses.

---

## **API Design**

1. **View Event**  
   **GET** `/events/:eventId`  
   Returns event details, including venue, performers, and available tickets.

2. **Search Events**  
   **GET** `/events/search?keyword={keyword}&start={start_date}&end={end_date}&pageSize={page_size}&page={page_number}`  
   Returns a list of events matching the search criteria.

3. **Book Tickets**  
   **POST** `/bookings/:eventId`  
   Input: Ticket IDs and payment details.  
   Output: A booking ID upon successful reservation.

---

## **System Design Overview**

1. **Event Viewing Service**  
   - Client requests for viewing an event are routed via an **API Gateway**.
   - The **Event Service** handles requests by querying the **Event DB** for event details, performers, and venue info.
   - The client receives the event details along with a seat map.

2. **Search Service**  
   - Client search requests are routed through the **API Gateway** to the **Search Service**.
   - The service queries the **Event DB** for events matching the search parameters and returns results to the client.

3. **Booking Service**  
   - The booking process starts with a POST request to the **Booking Service**, which checks ticket availability and processes payment.
   - The **Payment Processor** (e.g., Stripe) confirms the payment, and tickets are marked as "sold" in the **Ticket DB**.

---

## **Database Design**

- **Events DB**: Contains tables for events, performers, and venues.
- **Tickets DB**: Stores seat information, ticket status, and links to the booking data.
- **Bookings DB**: Tracks all user bookings, payment status, and ticket allocations.

---

## **System Scalability**

- **Microservices**: Event, search, and booking services are split into microservices to ensure scalability.
- **API Gateway**: Handles authentication, rate limiting, and routing to respective services.
- **Database Transactions**: The booking process uses database transactions to prevent double bookings, ensuring ACID compliance.

---

### **Conclusion**

This design ensures Ticketmaster can handle a high volume of read-heavy requests for viewing and searching events, while providing transactional consistency for ticket bookings. The system is highly available, scalable, and resilient to high traffic scenarios.
