## **Core System Components**

1. **User Management Service**: Manages user profiles, authentication, and authorization.
2. **Post Management Service**: Handles the creation, editing, and deletion of user posts, including text and media.
3. **Feed Generation Service**: Compiles personalized feeds for users based on their interactions and followed accounts.
4. **Notification Service**: Sends real-time notifications for likes, comments, and new followers.
5. **Media Storage Service**: Stores images and videos securely and efficiently, ensuring quick retrieval.
6. **Search & Discovery Service**: Enables users to search for other users and trending posts.

---

## **Core Functional Requirements**

1. **User Registration and Authentication**  
   Users must be able to register, log in, and manage their profiles securely.  

2. **Content Creation and Management**  
   Users can create, edit, and delete posts, including the ability to upload and attach media files.  

3. **Personalized Feed and Notifications**  
   The system should provide a personalized feed of posts and real-time notifications for user interactions, such as likes and comments.

---

## **Non-Functional Requirements**

### **Trade-Offs**  
1. **Scalability**  
   The system must handle a growing number of users and posts without degrading performance. This may involve trade-offs in data consistency during peak usage.

2. **Performance**  
   The platform should deliver fast response times for user interactions and feed generation, which may lead to caching strategies that prioritize speed over immediate data consistency.

---

## **Priority Ranking of Non-Functional Requirements**

1. **Scalability**  
   High priority to support an increasing user base and post volume. Strategies such as microservices, database sharding, and load balancing should be employed.

2. **Performance**  
   Critical to ensure fast user interactions and feed updates. This can be achieved through caching mechanisms and asynchronous processing.

3. **Data Consistency**  
   Important for maintaining user trust, especially regarding likes and comments. While some components may allow for eventual consistency, key interactions must maintain strong consistency.

4. **Resilience**  
   The system should have redundancy and failover mechanisms to maintain availability during outages or failures, though this is slightly less critical than scalability and performance.

5. **Security**  
   Protecting user data and ensuring secure transactions is essential, but can often be integrated with other design elements without excessive overhead.

## **Database Design**

### **Core Entities**

1. **User**: Stores user profile information, including username, password (hashed), email, and follower/following relationships.
2. **Post**: Represents an individual post, including the content, media URLs, and timestamps.
3. **Like**: Represents likes on posts, linking users and posts together.
4. **Comment**: Represents comments on posts, linking users to specific posts.
5. **Notification**: Represents notifications sent to users for interactions.

### **Database Tables**

1. **Users Table**  
   - `user_id`: Primary key.  
   - `username`: Unique username of the user.  
   - `password_hash`: Hashed password for authentication.  
   - `email`: User's email address.

2. **Posts Table**  
   - `post_id`: Primary key.  
   - `user_id`: Foreign key to the user.  
   - `content`: The text content of the post.  
   - `media_urls`: Array of media URLs.  
   - `created_at`: Timestamp of when the post was created.

3. **Likes Table**  
   - `like_id`: Primary key.  
   - `user_id`: Foreign key to the user who liked the post.  
   - `post_id`: Foreign key to the liked post.  

4. **Comments Table**  
   - `comment_id`: Primary key.  
   - `post_id`: Foreign key to the post.  
   - `user_id`: Foreign key to the user who commented.  
   - `content`: The text of the comment.  
   - `created_at`: Timestamp of when the comment was made.

5. **Notifications Table**  
   - `notification_id`: Primary key.  
   - `user_id`: Foreign key to the user receiving the notification.  
   - `type`: Type of notification (like, comment, follow).  
   - `created_at`: Timestamp of when the notification was created.

## **Scalability Considerations**

### **Microservices Architecture**  
Using microservices allows each component (user management, feed generation, post management) to scale independently, enhancing flexibility and scalability.

### **Load Balancing**  
A load balancer distributes incoming requests across multiple instances of the user, post, and feed services to maintain high availability and performance.

### **Caching**  
Implement caching (e.g., Redis) for frequently accessed data such as user feeds and trending posts to reduce database queries and improve response times.

### **Database Sharding**  
Sharding the database based on user IDs can help manage the high volume of reads and writes efficiently, reducing contention and improving overall performance.

### **Asynchronous Processing**  
Utilizing message queues (e.g., RabbitMQ or Kafka) for notifications and post processing ensures that user interactions are handled asynchronously, improving responsiveness.

---

## **System Resilience**

### **Data Consistency**  
Using distributed transactions ensures that likes, comments, and posts are consistently updated across the database to avoid discrepancies.

### **Eventual Consistency for Feeds**  
User feeds can leverage eventual consistency, allowing for quick updates to user feeds while managing database load efficiently.

### **Redundancy & Failover**  
Implement redundancy through multiple server instances and data replication across regions to ensure availability even during failures.

Query Access Pattern Considerations
When designing the database and API for the social media platform, optimizing query access patterns is critical for ensuring efficiency, scalability, and performance. Below are the key considerations for each core entity and feature:

### **Post Management Service** 
Fetch user posts by user ID (GET /users/:userId/posts).
Fetch post details by post ID (GET /posts/:postId).
Fetch posts by creation time for trending or recent posts.

- Index on user_id in the posts table for fast retrieval of posts per user.
- Index on created_at for time-based queries to support features like trending posts.

### **Feed Generation Service** 
Fetch user feed by user ID (GET /users/:userId/feed).
Fetch posts from followed users or based on user interactions.

- Index on user_id for personalized feed generation.
- Secondary indexes on post_id and created_at to efficiently retrieve posts from followed users.
- Consider maintaining a materialized view or denormalized feed table to optimize real-time feed generation.

### **Notification Service** 
Fetch notifications by user ID (GET /users/:userId/notifications).
Fetch notifications based on event type (e.g., likes, comments, follows).
 
- Index on user_id to quickly fetch notifications for a user.
- Index on created_at to display notifications in chronological order.

### ** Media Storage Service**
Fetch media files by URL or post ID.
Fetch media metadata (e.g., size, resolution) for optimization or display.

- Index on media_urls to facilitate quick lookups of media files based on post references.
